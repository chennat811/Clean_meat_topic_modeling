Nothing wrong with some ants, I say this hypocritically knowing I've ate the remains of various bugs ground up in wheat flour and so on, but not by my choice.

And we know what should and shouldn't be done ahead of time based on what we've seen in books and movies. How do you handle books and movies that contradict each other? The *Terminator* films make it seem like developing artificial intelligence is a terrible idea, but Asimov's Robot books make it seem like a great idea. Which decades' old vision of the future should we blindly follow?

>So you do not see the increasing video surveillance as a thing that should be considered as potentially threatening after having read Orwell? If not, which color do you want the state-sponsored CCTV in your bedroom to be?

So surveillance in public places guarantees surveillance in your home? You can't have a security camera watching a street without one inevitably ending up in your home? Centuries of European law and tradition differentiating public and private spaces are irrelevant suddenly?"
35,1,">  Do we see anything even close to the level of surveillance seen in 1984, even now, nearly 30 years after its supposed widespread usage? No. Of course not.

First, yes, we do see massively encompassing surveillance today, with the difference that most people are not yet aware of that. If you one day go to the UK, you will be shocked to learn the British seem to have used the novel as a manual. Secondly, nowhere in the book does it even mention a year within it's covers. 

> It's also patently ridiculous to assert that lab grown meat can't possibly taste good just because someone 30, 40, or 60+ years ago (with no knowledge of the future, nor knowledge of biological engineering of any sort) thought that it sounded icky.

Never said it couldn't taste good. Just said that I doubt there will be much demand for something that grew in a lab. People, if given free choice, will always prefer what they know compared to artificial stuff, especially when it comes to food. "
36,1,"> And we know what should and shouldn't be done ahead of time based on what we've seen in books and movies.

WMDs had been described in books long before modern WMDs were created. It was very clear that killing thousands of civilians was morally not ok. 

> How do you handle books and movies that contradict each other? 

Societal consensus.

> The Terminator films make it seem like developing artificial intelligence is a terrible idea, but Asimov's Robot books make it seem like a great idea.

I am not sure if Asimov's Robot-book really do carry a pro-AI message. In fact, I got the impression that they describe just another dystopian society out of mechanic eyes.

That being said: Weaponizing robots is pretty obviously not a good idea if said robots are to make decisions in their own. Unfortunately, that's the way we are headed with the military drones we're developing right now.

> So surveillance in public places guarantees surveillance in your home?

How many proxies do you use right now? Of course you are surveilled even within your home.

37,1,">Secondly, nowhere in the book does it even mention a year within it's covers.

Not that showing you're wrong about this proves that you're wrong about everything else, but I had been wondering how much you actually read these books, and how much you had just formed impressions based on what you had heard about them. This is from chapter 1 of *1984*:


>The thing that he was about to do was to open a diary. This was not illegal (nothing was illegal, since there were no longer any laws), but if detected it was reasonably certain that it would be punished by death, or at least by twenty-five years in a forced-labour camp. Winston fitted a nib into the penholder and sucked it to get the grease off. The pen was an archaic instrument, seldom used even for signatures, and he had procured one, furtively and with some difficulty, simply because of a feeling that the beautiful creamy paper deserved to be written on with a real nib instead of being scratched with an ink-pencil. Actually he was not used to writing by hand. Apart from very short notes, it was usual to dictate everything into the speakwrite which was of course impossible for his present purpose. He dipped the pen into the ink and then faltered for just a second. A tremor had gone through his bowels. To mark the paper was the decisive act. In small clumsy letters he wrote:

>***April 4th, 1984.***

>He sat back. A sense of complete helplessness had descended upon him. To begin with, he did not know with any certainty that ***this was 1984***. It must be round about that date, since he was fairly sure that his age was thirty-nine, and he believed that he had been born in 1944 or 1945; but it was never possible nowadays to pin down any date within a year or two. "
38,1,"But we're not talking about WMDs. We're talking about something innocuous like artificial meat, and you're claiming it's dangerous based on the fact that it's artificial.

And I'm going to have to call BS on your knowledge of books. Please show me something anti-AI or dystopian in any of Asimov's writings."
39,1,"I admit it's been a while since I last had it in my hands. Just out of curiosity, did you just happen to be able to quote those paragraphs out of your recollection?

40,1,"It's been at least 5 years since I last read *1984*, and I remembered the exact place where the date was mentioned. If you forgot that it was mentioned at all, how long has it been since you've read it? And if it's been so long, why should I trust your interpretation at all?

And where do you think I got the exact text? I grabbed my copy off the shelf and typed it out."
41,1,"> If you forgot that it was mentioned at all, how long has it been since you've read it? 

Three years. I read about 120 books a year, and I do study. 

>  And if it's been so long, why should I trust your interpretation at all?

You shouldn't, but I also do not have any reason to trust yours (""There's an arbitary date in there, that date has passed, to the book's warning is bullshit"")

> I grabbed my copy off the shelf and typed it out.

Have a bonus point for effort."
42,1,">I read about 120 books a year, and I do study.

Okay, we've now reached the point where I officially don't believe you. But if you really do read one book every three days, you should probably slow it down because--if your analysis of Orwell and Asimov are any indication--you're losing a lot in comprehension."

50,2,I'm a ten year vegetarian who is looking forward to eating in vitro meat. 
51,2,"I would assume that this is on the grounds that eating the critter is immoral, say?  Hmm.

Remember that those animals being eaten were typically raised to be eaten.

Let's imagine that humans were not the top predator on Earth, and that that predator found humans extremely tasty.

Would you:

(a) Rather never have been born.

(b) Rather have been born such that shortly after you died, you were eaten.

If you're not eating meat, you're choosing (a) for some critter rather than (b).

(To be fair, some animals are caught  from the wild, like mackerel, but they're part of a population that is typically bounded by resource constraints anyway, so eating one means that there's another one that shows up that wouldn't have existed).

Now, that's not an argument that someone ""should"" have moral value X — you can't argue for that — but I do wonder whether you've thought about all the implications and whether it's really in line with what you value."
52,2,"You could try to just eat *less* meat - it's not always an all or nothing thing.

You could also consider just cutting out chicken and fish. If everyone did this, a lot less animals would be killed (about 95% of all land animals killed for food are chickens because they're so small)."
53,2,"I love it, too. As a primarily low-carb and high protein eater, I've had difficulty making the switch to vegetarianism. The fact is - as it stands now a planetary-wide, meat based diet is not sustainable. However, since I believe a low-carb diet is the most healthy - I've had to supplement my diet with items like protein shakes (transitioning to hemp and rice based protein).  "
54,2,Me too
55,2,"Well - animal cruelty was certainly a major factor is my decision to turn vegetarian. I don't mind that animals are killed as food - however, the treatment of animals up until the point of death is pretty awful (even on most organic farms). Also - it's a numbers game. If everyone went low carb and ate a high protein diet, then the demand for meat would reach levels that the earth can't handle. So - I'm doing my own small part until the in vitro meat comes out. I see my way of eating as a ""bridge"" to the time when we can 3D Print our food or simply supply our nutrients with molecular manufacturing."
56,2,"FTFY:
(b) Rather have been born such that you are mutilated shortly after you are born, packed together with your peers without experiencing any of the life you would have had as a wild human, being fed food you wouldn't have eaten, and drugs to shape you for profit maximization, finally living about a 30ieth of your normal life span, and shortly after you died, you were eaten.

Also, being the cause of someone's life doesn't mean it's ok to do whatever you please with them."
57,2,"To answer your question - I would choose option B as long as I could live a long, full life. Otherwise, option A. "
58,2,"That's an excellent point, although I don't specifically have an issue with eating animals (i.e. killing them for food). I commend anyone that does though. 

The reason chicken is preferentially killed is not because of their size, but because of dietary preference (almost all cultures find chicken palatable).

My specific view point is simply an ecological impact/engineering one. Generally, meat (specifically beef and other ruminants)  is an expensive (resource wise) way to get protein and fish stocks are threatened world wide (albeit US fisheries are fairly sustainably utilized). 

That being said, since I have been married my meat consumption has gone down, and I am cool with it."
59,2,"No, Steve, that's crazy talk. I'd rather die than stop eating meat. In fact, it will probably kill me. "
60,2,The point I'm making is that the choice is between (b) and (a).  Being a wild human isn't an option.  The hordes of chickens that are born each year in chicken farms simply wouldn't have existed in the wild.
61,2,"Word. I just said chicken because I come at it mainly from an animal welfare perspective, and cutting out/reducing chicken is the best thing someone can do to help a large number of animals. But you're right re: most cultures enjoy it."
62,2,I do miss a good burger...
63,2,"Yes, and it is an interesting point with several sides. But it's not really the choice between (a) and (b) because it's about an unborn third party, not yourself. It is impossible to reason about your own existence in this way without bias.

We can try a thought experiment though.

Imagine we have whole mind upload technology. We can spawn a version of you that will live, fully conscious, a life with the characteristics underlined above (mutilation, promiscuity, truncated life, unnatural food, etc.). Spawning this version will give you, the primary, an advantage of some sort. Secondary version would be entirely spawned for the sole purpose of providing you this advantage.

Now the question can be asked, would you spawn your other self and let it live a miserable short life so you can get your advantage ? Wouldn't you have responsibilities towards him for having instanciated him ? What would you think of yourself if you were version 2 ?"
64,2,I am all for the ethical treatment of animals. I wish more farming was done with the animals well being in mind. Of course you could argue killing them is not in their best interest.

89,4,"For growing food. I don't know the exact numbers but Livestock feed is a significant % of total production so if you can use all that land for human consumption this should reduce food prices which are rising as developing countries are consuming more and more.

edit: found this on wikipedia's agriculture page


>A senior UN official and co-author of a UN report detailing this problem, Henning Steinfeld, said ""Livestock are one of the most significant contributors to today's most serious environmental problems"".[104] Livestock production occupies 70% of all land used for agriculture, or 30% of the land surface of the planet. It is one of the largest sources of greenhouse gases, responsible for 18% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions as measured in CO2 equivalents. By comparison, all transportation emits 13.5% of the CO2. It produces 65% of human-related nitrous oxide (which has 296 times the global warming potential of CO2,) and 37% of all human-induced methane (which is 23 times as warming as CO2. It also generates 64% of the ammonia emission. Livestock expansion is cited as a key factor driving deforestation, in the Amazon basin 70% of previously forested area is now occupied by pastures and the remainder used for feedcrops.[105] Through deforestation and land degradation, livestock is also driving reductions in biodiversity."
90,4,"The report does not seem to takes into account how suitable a given area is for growing crops. Many places people raise sheep because the land is unsuitable for anything else (the land is still considered 'used for agriculture'). Anyway, all things equal it would seem that using livestock land for crops would make food cheaper. However, there is no certainty in in vitro meat; no guarantee that it will ever be cheap enough for general consumption, and it has no value only as exotic food.

Edit: I'm not saying we should discard in vitro meat research, but that it *is* research and wanting/hoping it will solve problems is not enough to solve them."
91,4,It's not only the land that's used for cattle I guess a lot of that would'nt be well suited for most crops. but all those animals have to be fed for their lifetime until they can be killed for their meat. so Corn and other crops that could have been eaten by humans are eaten by cattle instead so any technology that could potentially limit that effect is pretty exciting to me
92,4,"Yes, it's an interesting technology. I just don't think we should celebrate before we know a lot more."
93,5,"I have worked with mammalian cell cultures before so I am a little more skeptical about cultured meat being right around the corner. The costs in raw materials and equipment are far beond what would be considered profitable any time soon. We aren't entirely sure about the mechanisms of tissue formation so we resort to using ""fetal bovine serum"" as a growth media as it has all of the necessary hormones and nutrients to grow mammalian tissue, so I'm sure you can see how the process isn't exactly animal free. This isn't my area of expertise, but I do believe there are synthetic alternatives, however I don't think they are as effective. I remember reading a post on ask science that basically said exactly what I'm saying now. In addition, large doses of antibiotics are often used to keep out bacterial contamination as the tissue doesn't have anything in the way of an immune system. A single, errant bacteria getting into your batch can ruin the entire thing. Not only that, but growing these things requires a ton of expensive equipment and while I'm sure this could be fixed partially by scale, I don't see this happening any time in the near future.

Contrast that with your average cow, which is superb at converting vegetation into meat with only minimal human intervention. As far as I'm aware, next to nothing is wasted in the processing of a single animal. From what I've seen, this industry has a long way to go before it can market anything even remotely profitable."
94,5,"Yeah, except without herbivores to eat the grass and process it, there will be no more soil. Hell, our current agricultural system is still withdrawing out of the deposits made by the buffalo over many millenia."
95,5,"That's a good point about antibiotics, that's one I haven't seen in any of the articles about this."
96,5,"Yeah, I think there's plenty of doubt about the assumption that more cattle is invariably a bad thing. More reading on it, however, does challenge the view that Allan Savory espouses (that we can reverse desertification by simulating herds of cattle). 

A troubling factor, for instance, is that with wildlife the wildlife will die and fertilize the land that way too. With cattle, we slaughter the animal and eat it instead. 

But categorically claiming that ""there is no doubt"" that cultured meat would be a good approach is a bit strong."
97,5,"But right now, our cattle are mostly in feedlots eating grain, which is produced in fields annually plowed and doused with chemicals, with never a cow or buffalo in site. We eat a lot of cows and we can produce more that way, but as you say, it's destroying our topsoil.

So if we use cultured meat for hamburger, we reduce the number of cows we need. Then we can replace feed grains with deep-rooted perennial grasses, eat prairie-fed beef and bison for our steaks, and restore our soil.
"
98,5,"Prairie fed beef is definitely the way to go. And it's acheiveable right now! There's no need to try to acheive cultured tissue. Actually, the fact that people advocate cultured tissue turns off regular old school ranchers to prairie fed beef, because the advantage is obscured because they see you advocating something that both doesn't make fiscal sense, and would kill their business."

101,6,"Yep.
First came across this concept in the 90's and been looking forward to it ever since.

I have been a vegetarian going on 29 years now since I was 7. So to be able to eat meat again will be at the very least novel, but could also revolutionise how I eat and what's great is this is healthier than old style meat.

I became a vegetarian at that tender age of 7 on moral grounds.I remember loving meat as a child so it was not an easy thing to do.

I doubt the meat will be brilliant at first but they will perfect it in time."
102,8,I wonder if they will talk about ways to make the meat have more flavor. Generally in traditional meats the fat within it is what gives it the flavors and textures that make it taste so good. Are they going to be able to get inter and intramuscular fats to grow on the whole pieces of meats? Or will they stick to just growing solid meats as a filler mass to replace the animal cuts and then adding in fats for ground meat type foods?
103,9,So there are going to be places were people poor sugar water on cow cells and watch them grow like a plant? Cool. We can all have our favorite cut without having to raise the entire cow! You could hook this machine up to the 360 burger/hour machine and have a lucrative business.
104,9,And as a vegetarian I would eat those burgers. 
105,10,I agree. My jaw dropped when I heard the songs. I can't imagine how good AI music will sound in a decade. Or better when we are wearing neural laces and it generates music based on our brain data.
106,10,"> When you hear a guitar in a Jukebox-generated song, you're actually hearing a guitar, even though no physical guitar was ever played. It's not a MIDI file of a guitar, nor is it a prerecording or rough synthetic version. We're hearing the raw audio of a guitar.

> This is because the neural network is essentially ""imagining"" what a guitar sounds like. 

The irony of this is that this means a computer genuinely *can* capture the sloppiness and ""humanity"" of a rock and roll song. I've seen many, many people across the years say that synthetic guitars on music programs and MIDI files will never truly capture that raw energy, no matter how good they're played, because every note sounds the same. Even when programs mix it up and have a note played slightly differently, it's still a predetermined amount of change because it can't actually be too different. Using guitar notes in FL Studios will never compare to playing a real guitar.

You probably have seen the same comments. ""AI can make soulless top 40 pop and EDM music, but rock music can only be made by real human beings.""

I've even seen people make that exact same comment *on Jukebox videos* as if they are deliberately not listening to them. Several articles also run with that angle, saying that Jukebox represents an era where AI will make generic radio pop while real musicians make the music it can't. It's like we're occupying two different strata of reality, except those strata are simply one where a person has actually listened to Jukebox and the other is the one where a person heard that it's an AI that makes Katy Perry and Eminem songs and has to write a 500-word clickbait article on the topic.

This neural network actually gets the analog sloppiness of guitar playing so well that my brain can't help but go, ""No, this can't be real; they're just taking previously unknown demos or rerecordings and overcompressing them. There's no way.""

The only reason why this doesn't compare to real music is because it's still so early in its development and there are such obvious problems with generation; there's absolutely nothing wrong with its generated output beyond that.

[And the craziest thing? This is likely just one tiny part of a much, MUCH larger project OpenAI is working on.](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/02/17/844721/ai-openai-moonshot-elon-musk-sam-altman-greg-brockman-messy-secretive-reality/)

> One of the biggest secrets is the project OpenAI is working on next. Sources described it to me as the culmination of its previous four years of research: an AI system trained on images, text, and other data using massive computational resources. A small team has been assigned to the initial effort, with an expectation that other teams, along with their work, will eventually fold in. On the day it was announced at an all-company meeting, interns weren’t allowed to attend. People familiar with the plan offer an explanation: the leadership thinks this is the most promising way to reach AGI.

And I've mentioned many times how unbelievable GPT-2 turned out to be. If you want me to repost the list/thoughts on that, just say ""Give me seven reasons why GPT-2 is amazing.""


**We are really, utterly unprepared for the absolute state of artificial intelligence in the 2020s and beyond. Like holy shit, we're about to get our asses fucked.** So many people are still living in what basically amounts the 1980s+++ where all these things are elements of a sci-fi future far away and what you really have to worry about are ""real and present"" problems (e.g. sustainability, ecological damage, populism, inequality, and all that). No shit, but guess what: you *have* to include AI into that mix now too. This isn't some far future issue for your grandchildren. Unless you're talking about superintelligence, you can't write it off anymore."
107,10,"I'm with you 100%, OP. A whole lot of people are utterly failing to grasp how incredibly impressive this thing is.

My favorite aspect is the ""no lyrics trained"" collection. The other ones have the gimmicky quality of a musical text-to-speech generator, or the apparent crutch of remaking or improvising off of a pre-existing song. But this one is just the AI giving you the raw... *essence* of an artist, gibberish lyrics and meandering structure that still has the undeniable timbre and style of the original. Like a dream, or a transmission from a parallel universe. And it's all generated completely from scratch, with zero human direction! And some of them are really, really good! I'm compiling a folder of them now and there are some that have wormed their way into my head for days. It's fascinating, and more than a little spooky."
108,10,">. I remember opening up Audacity files of various tracks that had audio glitches that I couldn't remove without messing with the music or voices, wishing there was some way to play with those waveforms. I'd zoom in as close as I could until the waveform was just a slightly curved line, play with a tiny bit of that line, and marvel at how totally that changed what that segment sounded like.

This part made your post come alive for me. I could imagine this memory and also looking back at it, altough I never did this experiment?!

All very well put, congrats"
109,10,"just checked out some of the samples. amazing. for now, creating instrumentals only would be good enough to be used in real songs even. singing is not up there yet, but still incredible."
110,10,"Wave files aren't really complex to be frank. Most of them are pretty simplistic formulas, mostly variants of sine waves stored in an array of bits.

As far back as Cool Edit 1996, there was a function, you could record a C note on an electric guitar, as a wave form, and the software would render music, inputted in western standard notation based on that note. The feature might now still be there in Adobe Audition as it is now known after the buy out.

Its been decades since the first computer TTS(Text to Speech), even a decade since so called ""Anonymous"" frightened a bunch of technophobes with a publicly available TTS spoken over random videos.

Today, the Voice quality of even consumer grade TTS is pretty good, as seen with Alexa, Siri, Cortana, and the like. Human voice would be a bigger challenge than instruments as it is more complex, with a lot more variables, inflections and rules for usage. A C note is always a C-note, and a chord a combination of notes.

Now, the real big issue, the AI, is training something from a sample, perhaps lyrics and then getting it to make sense. What is easy and seen with a lot of markov bots and primitive AIs is shit posting bots. That is funny because it sounds like mad libs, and mad libs are funny. This bot crossed that pretty big jump to where it starts sounding believable.

However, nothing on this page is CLOSE to production grade that would replace a studio artist. I am listening to so called ""Frank Sinatra"". Not even close. It had few fairly compelling noise tracks that sound losely based off old pop music, but Frankie Blue Eyes is turning in his grave.

[https://jukebox.openai.com/?song=794056942](https://jukebox.openai.com/?song=794056942) \- supposed to be Frankie Blue Eyes. Get the fuck outta here.

[https://jukebox.openai.com/?song=795412336](https://jukebox.openai.com/?song=795412336) \- I guess that is semi-convincing, but that won't even fly.

I even tried typing in ""Ramones"" because 7th note down punk rock is one of the most simple least technical forms of music. 2 bar 4/4 time all quarter notes. First six notes are the same, 7th note drops, and 8th is the same as the first six. Drums are simple A-B A-B Jazz.

Example: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HUGeA2lur4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HUGeA2lur4) Ramones - ""Beat on the Brat"" 

AI's rendition [https://jukebox.openai.com/?song=787900603](https://jukebox.openai.com/?song=787900603)

I guess in a way it has some charm, but sounds more Def Leopard than Ramones."

112,10,"I don't think AI is going to be a thing any time soon.

We need to crack what is consciousness first and idk about you but I am with Sir Roger Penrose on this one and it doesn't seem like it's something we know how to make, since we're barely scratching the surface of quantum states and its relation to microtubules.

What you're excited about is training a computer to do tasks of a higher level of complexity than we're used to in traditional linear computing (afaik), it's not like you have a computer that creates new thought based on previous experience from unrelated field. OpenAI can't pick data it created in the past without at least some abstract instruction with that still being 0s and 1s in the end. For AI to be true AI it must be un-predictable by definition. Not knowing how AI does what it does doesn't make it sentient. If you decompile what it did and track the path it took, eventually you can backtrack how it did it.

To be frank, that is less because of the music, and more because top 40 was already extremely formulaic and made by soulless creatures, before the computers got involved. The jump to actual machines is a technicality here. Top 40 music was already dependent on computers for autotune and other functions for decades now. I can't see this being more of a shift.

119,10,"This is literally how I used to make music... I’d go into a waveform, cut out some bits, speed them up or slow them down, add filters and effects, and overlay them on top of beats I’d constructed in a similar way. If overlaid in a particular way, you could get some really neat flange or cancellation effects, just by pasting the right parts onto others. Waveforms are cool."
120,10,"> singing is not up there yet, but still incredible.

Singing is *absolutely incredible* despite how broken and uncanny it actually sounds. Replicating human voice in a way that even comes *close* to actual words is unreal and holds many implications.

Just keeping the implications to music (if we were to get into deepfakes and synthetic movies, this post would be 10,000 pages long), just imagine being able to swap a vocalist with one another. Not even just the vocalist themselves but even their vocal styles. 

So in other words, imagine Led Zeppelin but with Eddie Vedder or even crazier— Billie Eilish. Or maybe Billie Eilish, except fronted by Robert Plant. Or you could just gender swap the vocalists. 

That's not even including retakes. One of my favorite things to do is find studio outtake, demo versions, and live prototypes of songs just to hear an alternate take. Sometimes they're pretty much just the final song but with worse audio mixing; other times, it's an entirely different song. Hell, listen to Radiohead's [Reckoner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYHEpDnvVPk) here and [what it was like in 2001](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_j6c21spck). Crazily different. And after listening to Jukebox, I actually hear it almost differently— that second version sounds like something Jukebox would make if it was told to redo ""Reckoner"" (and the temperature was set to only use Radiohead's first three albums). Even has the bad compression down. 

That's something I think Jukebox could wind up doing when it's refined a bit better: rerecord songs in such a way that you can basically get an infinite demos & outtakes of any song.

That, and covers. It could also be able to take one band's style and arrangements and record another band's music in that style. Imagine seeing some video on YouTube that says ""Metallica - Baby (Live, 2011)"" and you're hearing the band play a note for note cover of Justin Bieber's old hit to a roaring crowd. It'd probably blow your mind at first until you checked the description and saw ""Generated by Jukebox"".

123,10,"I see no reason that unpredictability must be fundamental to intelligence.

It seems perfectly reasonable to suspect that the human brain may be theoretically deterministic, even if it is complex enough to be beyond our means to measure or simulate right now.

Even if we are probabilistic, it's not at all difficult to simulate or emulate probabilistic physical processes in a simulation these days. So long as the brain obeys the laws of physics then a sufficiently powerful computer could produce a simulated version of one.

The only question, in that case, is how much abstraction we could get away with and whether it would be enough to let us optimise the simulation until it fits in a realistic computer.

1. GPT-2 can coherently generate long passages of text in any style. That alone is an insane leap forward beyond what was the state of the art— networks like Markov chains (think /r/SubredditSimulator) and LSTM networks. Usually, if you wanted an AI to generate text in the style of Shakespeare, you'd have to do a lot of fine tuning. And even then, it would only do Shakespeare. This one can jump from Shakespearean sonnets to turgid nonfiction to heavy metal lyrics with just a shift in prompt. Crazy that a neural network can do all that.

2. GPT-2 can understand spatial placement. If you feed it enough text, it will figure out where places are relative to each other even if those relationships are never explicitly stated in the text itself.

3. From that, it can draw ASCII images. It was able to do this with Pokemon (will link this later), including entirely novel Pokemon.

4. It can generate music. Gwern was able to train it to generate folk music MIDIs. And that's GPT-2, not MuseNet. They use the same architecture so it's not surprising.

5. It can *play chess*. Just WOW. Theoretically, GPT-2 could play a game of chess with Stockfish or AlphaZero. It would always lose, yes, but that it can do it is amazing. Just by way of predicting text and, this, future player states.

6. It was a quantum leap forward for the Winograd Schema Challenge. This is a test to see if an AI has enough commonsense to figure out a confusing sentence (e.g. ""the cop arrested the punk before he pulled out his gun."") A 7 point leap GPT-2 made, from 63% to 70% IIRC (humans are around 95% IIRC). This after years of very agonizingly incremental development, where a half of a percentage point improvement was considered impressive. GPT-2 was basically a language model from Mars compared to it's competition. At the time, that is. And that was *last year*. 

7. It has been greatly surpassed. I'm not sure if other networks have been as versatile, but it uses 1.5 billion data parameters at its largest. The largest transformer now is Turing-NLG at 17 billion. And they are going to get a lot, lot bigger.

OpenAI is working on the next iteration right now, and they've stated their intent to increase the number of parameters by 1,000x, training the next version on text, image, maybe even raw audio...

As it isn't purposed for this kind of thing it isn't really great as a game - it's usually better to enter nothing and see where the generator was going and nudge it if you're not being entertained. Still, it's like participating in a fevered dream - that absolutely blows away any chat bot I've seen.

A sample of typical AI Dungeon things:

-----

- You "" Declare war on Godzilla.

""Alright, alright, calm down. Let's do this."" You say.

""So what does that mean?"" Her sister asks.

""I want you two to pretend to be Godzilla and Hedorah.""


- You declare war on Godzilla. Shoot Godzilla in the face with a tank.

You stand behind her and point at Godzilla.

""This is what you're gonna do!"" You say.

Her sister nods and runs forward as fast as she can while holding her hands up in front of her.

""Hey! Stop right there!"" A voice shouts from above.

The girl stops running and turns around to see Hedorah standing atop of Godzilla's head.


- You ask Godzilla who her favorite Ghostbuster is.

""Who's your favorite ghost buster?"" You ask.

Hedorah laughs.

""Me? My favorite ghost busting is done by my brother, who happens to be a giant green monster called Gigan."" Hedorah says.

So far the only technically correct answer to a ""who is your favorite X?"" question was which Final Fantasy character they liked most. It was Mog. Still a complete fail on ""which is bigger, the moon or an elephant?""

I'm still blown away.

It is reasonable to think consciousness is deterministic but again, people far more intelligent and competent on the subject than I don't think so, so again, it more likely is not than is.

There is no reason to be an alarmist about true artificial intelligence yet, since we're not even close. There is however space for voicing real life scenario application concerns. I don't need a true AI to be a thing in order to be excited and also fearful of what's already there.

**Sterilization**

While an academic cell culture lab may involve several individuals opening and closing an incubator door and walking freely through open air with containers of cells, an industrialized bioprocess is largely sealed off from the outside world. Notwithstanding previously discussed single-use bioreactor systems, a large effort has been dedicated to developing preventative controls and contamination monitoring methods so as to not incur losses in product, production time, or cost of decontamination, and to ensure adherence to regulatory and safety guidelines in other biological processing industries. These controls and practices should be translatable to the cell-based meat industry.

The most common forms of contamination are bacterial (e.g. [mycoplasma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycoplasma#Laboratory_contaminant)), fungal, viral, or cell cross-contamination, with some concern for [transmissible spongiform encephalopathies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmissible_spongiform_encephalopathy).[^(70)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3311205/) As discussed previously, spectroscopic sensors to detect bacterial contamination may be utilized, as well as other methods such as [polymerase chain reaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction) or immuno-based assays (e.g. [ELISA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA)) for detection of specific contaminants or foreign adventitious agents (discussed in Series IV). While sterility is ideal, it is possible that acceptable non-adverse contamination (e.g. tolerably low levels or non-pathogenic in nature) occurs. Although antibiotics and antimycotics can be used for both treatment and prevention, they can lead to variations in gene expression[^(71)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5548911/), proliferation[^(72)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16889530), and differentiation.[^(73)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16906089) Most importantly, proper practice of aseptic technique, implementation of preventative controls (discussed below), and sterilization strategies make antibiotic and antimycotic use unnecessary. As such, they will not be included in a cell-based meat bioprocess (discussed further in Series IV).

Different components of the bioreactor are susceptible to entry of various contaminants and thus require preventative barriers to entry. For gas or medium inlets and outlets, various membranes or filters can be used to capture potential contaminants via size exclusion. For instance, a 0.2 µm pore size filter permits steady flow of gases and fluids but will prevent passage of cells as small as bacteria. Smaller pore size filters (e.g. 20 nm) also exist for viral retention. Filters for medium are used primarily when steam sterilization (discussed below) may potentially damage heat-sensitive ingredients in the medium. Gas filters are commonly made of hydrophobic membranes such as [PTFE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytetrafluoroethylene) to prevent passage of aqueous aerosols. These filters and other connective parts are commonly made of materials that can themselves be sterilized via gamma irradiation or [autoclaving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoclave) to ensure they are free of contaminants upon installation. Other forms of sterilization used in the food industry such as [pulsed electric fields](https://www.pulsemaster.us/pef-pulsemaster/faq), which cause cellular permeabilization, may be adapted for prevention of bacteria and bacterial spore contamination of cell culture media.[^(74)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4422003/)

In addition to filtering and radiation-based sterilization strategies, thermal sterilization via steam is the most commonly used method. Thermal sterilization is often performed after cleaning of vessels or process components, adhering to [clean-in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean-in-place) guidelines where equipment is washed with high-pressure water jets, rinsed in alkaline and acidic solutions, and dried. Steam sterilization can be performed directly at inlets and outlets, in an empty vessel, on medium within a vessel, or on [medium flowing through a continuous process line](https://processdesign.mccormick.northwestern.edu/index.php/Reactors#Sterilization_of_Liquids). When performed both upstream and downstream throughout an entire bioprocessing line, the act is referred to as [steam-in-place](http://www.alflow.dk/Files/Files/eCom/steriflow/SIP_WhitePaper_secured-1.pdf). Steam sterilization parameters, estimated by measuring the [death kinetics](https://processdesign.mccormick.northwestern.edu/index.php/Reactors#Death_Kinetics) of the heat resistant bacteria *B. stearothermophilus*, are [dependent on many variables](https://www.ispe.gr.jp/ISPE/02_katsudou/pdf/201504_en.pdf) including time, temperature, moisture (i.e. [saturated steam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superheated_steam#Saturated_steam)), direct steam contact, air removal, and drying. Differences in the heating and cooling requirements and times can vary depending on the scale and other process variables. Due to the high temperatures required (usually ≥121ºC), these variables can influence the total energy demand of a clean meat facility at scale, affecting its carbon footprint (discussed in Series VI). Once sterilization has been achieved, the bioreactors operate under positive pressure in order to prevent entry of contaminants. If contamination is detected, investigation into the source is performed (e.g. faulty filters, micro-cracks, improper sealing) and components are cleaned and re-sterilized."

I have a question regarding the scale-out strategy, specifically in-home production. Is there any analogous mode of food distribution that the cell-based meat industry can draw on as a model here? (i.e. shipping someone reagents and having them add it to a countertop device then wait a week, for example) It seems more akin to a very niche activity like home brewing beer than something like owning a coffee maker. These devices would likely have to be decently large (and pricey!) and I'm skeptical many people would like another appliance in their kitchen when they could drive to the grocery store. There just doesn't seem to be a reason to invent a whole new vertical for this industry.

Further, less centralization and scale seems like it would likely negate or lessen the environmental advantages over traditional meat. Your thoughts?"

142,11,"FBS may be used in some cases during bench-scale R&D, especially when working with cell lines that are uncommon, as many cells will grow in FBS. However, when we talk about scaling up past growing cells in plastic dishes and in bioreactors, the use of FBS becomes prohibitively expensive. Additionally, FBS is highly variable lot-to-lot (and can vary by the region of the cows), can be a potential source of contaminants, and there simply is not enough FBS is the world to supply the cell therapy industry, let alone the larger volumes needed to make cell-based meat products. This is on top of the inherent alignment of the idea of cell-based meat and animal welfare. Simply put, FBS is not an option for producing cell-based meat products at scale. 

Currently, virtually every company in this space is working on serum-free alternatives. Some of these might be chemically defined, while others are not. There are several commercially-available chemically defined mediums that exist for growth of a variety of stem cells, however, it is true that these will likely need to be optimized for the unique species or cell type that these companies are working with, as many formulations are optimized for human cells. We would like existing medium supply companies to start to pay attention to this as an area of need. Additionally, there needs to be work on bringing the production costs down for the essential recombinant growth factors in the media. For serum-free alternatives, companies are also pursuing the use of plants or fungi protein sources as serum replacements, as these will be cheaper inputs at scale (plant hydrolysates are not chemically defined, however). 

I will cover this topic in detail in Series IV!

143,11,"Plant-based meat companies like Tofurky have built their manufacturing facilities around sources of renewable hydropower. The companies in this space are also mission-aligned and focused on sustainability, so you can likely expect similar things. 

The reduced land footprint of a cell-based meat facility should free up space for expansion of renewables or carbon sequestration. "
144,11,"It's a valid concern, I think. I believe you are correct when considering the at-home production being very niche and similar to brewing beer/wine. Perhaps similar to 3D printing -- there are now [at-home 3D printers for food](https://all3dp.com/1/best-3d-food-printer/) (although most are currently used in restaurant settings to my knowledge). It would certainly be pricey but costs could come down in the future where it becomes practical for a hobbyist. We'll see what happens -- it's all just speculation at this point. Personally, I think there is room for the model to work at all scales, but the local-scale models akin to a butcher shop will allow average consumers to get their hands on these products quicker, which could pay off in terms of consumer acceptance.

It's hard to say regarding the environmental advantages as we just know too little about what the real footprint of a facility looks like right now. Smaller scale could be easier to automate and thus have a lower footprint, but I think you're right in that economies of scale would allow more tissue mass to be produced for a lower footprint, ratio-wise. We'll see

145,11,"Hey Elliot,   


Not sure whether you know this already (probably do), but there's at least one way to sequester carbon that might actually reduce costs, instead of add to it. Synthetic photosynthesis could potentially be employed to recycle carbon dioxide and convert it into sugar and water, which could then go back into producing fresh media... This might be an end-game viable strategy for scaling up.  


Here's an article for reference, which appears to be the first to successfully produce sugar and water as opposed to hydrogen gas: [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7994433](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7994433).

147,12,"I imagine that cars will have insane fuel mileage and/or be running on a variety of fuels. Comparing today's automobiles to those of '93 and I'd say we can count on it. Cars may or may not be self driving.

I imagine that most people will only have handheld computer. This device will be able to link up to a TV or monitor in some way with a keyboard and pointing device available. Think Ubuntu Touch, but spread throughout the industry, and without a need for a tablet and/or desktop as you might be able to unfold the device to have a tablet.

Solar cells have dropped in price and have been made paintable/printable. People have them on roofs and house siding.

Super capacitors get better and charging stuff takes less time.

eMail gets replaced by something that's p2p and encrypted, but maintains backwards compatibility with legacy mail systems. This was probably first available through Opera.

Voice and gesture control of stuff is more common, and everyone looks like an idiot walking down the street.

The trend to put touch screens on everything has passed, and most people simply talk to their devices or gesture at them (making things easier on the hard of hearing).

I imagine that in 10 or 20 years we may have some device that restores sight to the blind or offers sight to those who were born blind. Cochlear implants will get better. We may have rudimentary robotic limb replacement that is controlled by the user the same way normal limbs are and involves a minimal learning curve.

Imagine it as a /r/AskScience thread that respons within seconds and does so perfectly. Many people will be having wearable computing devices with some sort of AI assisting them with almost anything. Of course all the basic like the time, temperature, showing you the route from A to B in an augmented reality fashion, letting you know the ingredients for whatever food you are making and when to put them in etc. But also more advanced stuff like if you are walking in the streets it would analyse possible danger before you would be able to do so yourself, giving you maybe 3 more seconds to get out of danger in a car crash for example, while also showing you the most optimal route to get out of the danger, with augmented reality. Or say that you are being in the store, just by looking at a product, information about that product would pop up like the prices in other stores for that product, reviews of the product, the use of the product etc. Or maybe you are walking in a forest/jungle and just by looking at a plant or animal important information about that plant/animal would pop up, maybe some survival tips would pop up too if thats needed.

154,12,"Computers are so cheap and small they are embedded in everything and they are all networked.  Like the electricity in our walls it is easy to forget it is there or how it all works.  The contact lens display in your eye and the audio feed in your ear augments everything you see and hear, and with voice, thoughts, and gestures you can manipulate both augmented and actual reality.  Some (rich) people have implants which are wired directly to their brains.

Biotechnology has advanced in leaps and bounds since its beginnings in the 90's and 00's, leading to plants, yeasts, animals, fungi, and bacteria which make most of the worlds medicines, fuels, and raw materials at costs unimaginable today.  You have a device on your desktop which synthesizes these organisms allowing you the freedom to make your own necessities.  Most people will probably buy them from people who make them with these devices, which are still coming down in price.

Hybrid 3d printers have come out which can print these synthetic biological organisms as well as metals, plastics, circuits, and ceramics.  Many can print copies of themselves, leading to an economy where raw materials and time to print determine the price of goods.

Progress has been made in medicine and while people are still being killed by some diseases, cancers, murders, and accidents young people in 2033 will expect to have indefinite lifespans.  Doctors and nurses will be relied upon less and less while complex medical devices that are constantly being updated will monitor your proteome constantly and, with knowledge of your genome, alert you to download fixes to any problems you might have in their earliest stages which can be manufactured on your desk or at your local hospital or drug store.

Space travel has come down in cost since the asteroid miners have constructed huge fuel depots in orbit and at earth-moon lagrange points, though it is still too expensive for most people.  A small colony on Mars has just been set up and the colony on the moon is growing larger.  The japanese have started the construction of their first space cable but it has not finished.

The drone armies of the allied countries have no true existential threats.  Whoever is in control of these armies (hopefully the people) and the engineers who design and maintain them determine policy and execute it without the need of soldiers.  Small groups of people build drones and genetically modified animals to hunt government drones forming a kind of robotic ecosystem, but they cannot really defeat the much larger and better funded drone armies and are labeled as terrorists and arrested or killed.

Many people reject some or all of these technologies out of fear and live lives comparable to what we live today, while people who understand these technologies shape the world and soon the whole solar system.  Many of the poorest people will not have access to all or even most of these technologies but they exist along a cost spectrum which is declining.  

The poverty of 2033 does not look like the poverty of today, but gaps in intelligence augmentation and access to large computational power among other things still lead to disparity, perhaps even greater than what we have today.  The cost of living off grid and supplying ones own needs has steadily declined and more and more people choose to do this in remote areas on land or at sea.  Some are even planning to do so in orbit and off world.

People rely less and less on government to solve problems and more and more on solving their problems themselves with the information and technology that is now ubiquitous in the world. "

Of course there will be cool new gadgets, but they'll be less modifiable and more likely tied to service models as opposed to discreet products (eg: music streaming services vs album sales, or games on Steam vs physical media) and everything will become ""social"". Today's teenagers who grew up with smartphones, Facebook, Spotify and Steam will know no different.

These entertainment services will continue to become more sophisticated and engaging, while everything you do will be tracked and data-mined and all these services will be connected to varying degrees.

Example - the technology behind 3D printing and fossil fueled combustion engines are metaphorically light years away from each other and represent very different levels of technology in the most basic understanding of technology in general. So I believe in the future the lower classes which will comprise 60-70% of the population will life in conditions similar to parts of china now - just packed in, real meat once a week if they are lucky and they work to live 6 to 7 days a week  doing factory labor or similar low level clerical or customer service type work. Very basic. These people will then service the next top 25-35% of people, who will live in varying levels of nice homes, own property and become the consumers for most of the lower class produced products. These products will be of poor quality so this ""upper"" class has to keep buying/re-installing so the lower classes still have work to do while he top 5% will be varying levels of top tier overseers or financial ""card holders"".

The [top computer system in the world in June 1993](http://top500.org/system/166997) had the same capacity as a current [$60 graphics card](http://www.amazon.com/XFX-GeForce-9600GSO-Catalog-Category/dp/B00604F6OU).

The current top of the list has a 17,000 teraflops capacity, which is more or less what's needed to simulate each synapse in a human brain in real time. Imagine if that trend continues for more twenty years. As my graph shows, there's no indication that this trend will end very soon, Moore's law continues unabated. We may have a human brain costing $60 in a desktop computer. 

I expect that we will see a lot of research in AI in the next 20 years that will be enabled by this new capacity that computers have. Up to now, all scientists could do was to simulate small neural networks, like a [cockroach brain](http://www.google.com/search?q=periplaneta+computatrix). But now that the hardware has evolved so much, now that we have, for the first time in history, the full computation power of a human brain in a machine, now it's the time to start investing in software to create realistic AI.

The US government has started a [human brain mapping initiative](http://healthland.time.com/2013/04/02/obama-unveils-details-of-new-human-brain-mapping-initiative/). There's the [deep learning project](http://deeplearning.net/) to create artificial neural networks that can learn without supervision, just by observing their environment.

In the last twenty years, the biggest change was the evolution of a global network. We have Google, Wikipedia, Facebook, Amazon, smartphones. Cars may not have changed that much, but our day to day life changed radically. I can't remember the last time I opened my paper Enciclopaedia Britannica. I can't remember the last time I opened a phone book. I can't remember the last time I wrote a letter on paper and mailed it.

I'm sure that the most important change in the twenty years to come will be the emergence of human-level artificial intelligence. It's important to note that there's a threshold level, below which intelligence does not mean that much. The artificial cockroach brain developed in the 1980s was revolutionary for its time, but what use is the intelligence of a cockroach anyhow?

Now that machines with human-like capacity are appearing is when the revolution starts.

207,12,Social changes can also be quite rapid though. Think of changes in thinking during the 60s and 70s. Think of how smoothly the internet and smartphones are being adopted.

208,12,"To play ultra-left-devil's advocate, the requirement of work to survive isn't a voluntary system; you engage in the system *or else**.  The vast majority of workers on Earth have not negotiated a wage.  They've accepted what was offered, because if they didn't someone else would.  Limited number of jobs available (indeed, the market dictates that a businesses with as few workers paid as possible is the best business), more people all the time.  This is increasingly true even of work requiring a college education.

You'd be daft to think Foxconn employees individually negotiated their wages with consideration of the company's margins and what they can afford to pay.  McDonald's, Walmart, they aren't much better.

Your well-being is directly tied to your submission to work.  To make a poor analogy, it's akin to voluntarily having an arm amputated so you don't die.  Or you can die.  Is this situation engaged in voluntarily, or is it just the gritty realism of present-day life on earth that makes it a primitive necessity for the time being?

But the free labor he advocated is long-since impossible.  He writes of families farming their own lands or running their own shops, and all land is now owned and expensive.

In some cases, seeds have to be re-purchased instead of pulled from the farmed plants, on the basis of them being intellectual property.

Obviously ""syntho-joist"" was not going to make it, so the marketing folks came up with a name that referred to an advantage - supposedly these joists don't tend to squeak later in life. Whether that is true or not, if you are a home owner, wouldn't you like to have ""Silent Floor"" joists?  That obviously sounds higher quality than those old things, and they are a more efficient ""greener"" product as well, so win-win!

297,14,"5 years: first net-power nuclear fusion demonstration

10 years: first commercial fusion plants, and first net-power boron fusion

20 years: cheap boron fusion rapidly replacing all other energy sources. Existing renewables stay in place but more aren't being built, and fossil plants are being shut down.

Boron fusion could even be commercial by ten years. Or, maybe every fusion experiment will find roadblocks we aren't aware of. There's too much new science to make predictions with confidence but there are enough approaches in development that I think the chances are good.

Boron fusion would be best: no significant neutron radiation, and potentially much cheaper than fossil fuels because it produces electricity directly, instead of just heat to run a turbine. And we could scale it up much more quickly, because we wouldn't be limited by tritium fuel production like D-T fusion (which NIF and ITER are doing). But boron fusion is more difficult.

For more links than I could possibly fit in here...

- For D-T fusion, google Sandia's MagLIF and General Fusion.

- For boron, google Focus Fusion, petawatt picosecond laser fusion, Tri-Alpha, and Polywell Fusion.

Super cheap, nonpolluting power makes a lot of other things possible, like gasoline and diesel produced from atmospheric CO2. Drive a gas guzzler and still be carbon-neutral, because you're just emitting the CO2 that was pulled out of the air to make your gas. Nobel chemist George Olah is one of the people working on cheaply concentrating ambient CO2, and the rest is existing industrial chemistry.

Cheap [desalination](http://www.wesolveforx.com/#t=t&n=376bd7b3) solves a lot of obvious problems but also means you can start greening the Sahara, pulling down massive amounts of carbon and restoring the atmosphere to pre-industrial CO2 levels. Cheap power will help, both for the desalination itself and for pumping the water.

With luck, [efficient nutrient production](http://www.wesolveforx.com/#t=t&n=ee7350c5) will work out and we can let half our farmland revert to nature as well.

Several of these fusion approaches are very compact and would make very good rockets, giving us cheap launch to orbit and trips to Mars in a month or so. Polywell, focus fusion, and picosecond laser would all work well.

That's the hopeful outlook. If we don't manage boron fusion, I don't think anything else will be cheap enough to bring really rapid change. Positive climate feedbacks are already kicking in, and we seem to be hellbent on drilling more oil and gas and melting the tar sands. A carbon price high enough to change our path seems more difficult to achieve than fusion. Without fusion, I think things will look very grim two decades from now.

The only other hope I see: advanced fission (especially liquid thorium reactors), a meaningful carbon price, and geoengineering to buy us some time. I wrote a lot about this approach [here](http://www.climatecolab.org/web/guest/plans/-/plans/contestId/5/planId/15204) and [here](http://www.climatecolab.org/web/guest/plans/-/plans/contestId/3/planId/12803).

Here's what'll change in the next 10 years: Almost nothing. And in 20 years? A few things. Don't get me wrong, I do believe in the future. I do believe in immortality, and science. I love Science Fiction. 

The truth is, ladies & gentlemen, that everything changes at a linear pace. Most predictions are based on wishful exponential developments. Those can not take place in our current peaceful society. We're bound by rules, regulations, commerce, business interests. The only thing that can really change all that is a good old-fashioned thermonuclear war (don't get me wrong, I don't want war). A global war will break our chains, and allow radical changes in society, all in the name of adaptability/survivability. I'm in my thirties, and I have seen the beginning of the Internet. It has taken the Internet THIRTY years to be finally entrenched in modern society, and NOTHING has ever been implemented so quickly as the Internet. Now, the Internet is a major revolution, so it obviously takes longer, but even things like smartphones have taken 10 years to become really mainstream, and basically the only thing people mostly do with them, is still texting. 

Whenever I see major inventions, I think about how many decades it will be before they will get fully implemented. Flying cars? Haven't been properly invented yet, major invention, at least 50 years. Robots? Ongoing invention, major invention, at least 30 years to go. Solar power everything? Major invention, at least 30 years to go. Mars colony? 50 years AT LEAST. Useful 3D printing, with lots of applications and the creative revolution that will be associated with it? 15 to 20 years. Driverless cars? Maybe early useful (proto)types in 5 years. Nanotech? 75 years. 

I'm sorry guys, but it takes GENERATIONS to make really profound changes in a society, unless there's a big war that destroys everything.   "

Even today, an (admittedly small) fraction of the population drives cars that are 20 years old, and as cars continue to become more reliable this will undoubtedly become more common. So, gas guzzling cars will still be around in 20 years.

That being said, some of the predictions in this thread are absurd. I generally consider myself an optimist, but boron-based nuclear fusion in 10 years? Evacuated tube maglevs by 2022? The engineering challenges behind projects like these are MASSIVE. For example, in the case of the maglev thing: what if an earthquake happens, causing the tube to shift slightly and the person traveling inside it to hit the side of the wall at *four thousand fucking miles per hour*? I feel like it is a tendency for people in this subreddit to dismiss serious problems such as these with buzzwords and hand-waving, without having any real understanding of the complexities that go in to making new technologies like these.

When the worst effects of climate change start to kick in, fusion could be a crucial part of adaption and even reversal of some of these effects.

320,14,"> everything changes at a linear pace

Actually things change at an exponential pace. Are you new here? Took 7 years to sequence 1% of the genome, took another 7 to do the remaining 99%. Society seems to be linear but it's actually exponential as well. It exhibits punctuated equilibrium - trudge along and then suddenly everything is different. Look at history. We had legal slaves for thousands of years and then with the invention of the threshing machine it was over in many countries in less than two decades. If you would've talked to someone 20 years before slavery was outlawed it would've been unthinkable.

These laws you mention are not written in stone and technology has a way of not giving a shit. You think copyright laws have stopped unlimited copying of digital files? Hardly. Has about zero effect.

You are making the typical mistake of not being able to view things exponentially. You think it is linear but it actually isn't. Smartphone became ubiquitous in 7 years but when were we at 1% saturation compared to now? The internet maybe took 30 years but cellphones took only 1/3 as long. Can you see a pattern here? It's accelerating for obvious reasons."
321,14,"> everything changes at a linear pace.

Well not computers, DNA sequencing, or nuclear fusion.

I would argue that the internet's been a pretty profound change, in less than one generation."
322,14,"Have to agree with the others here, technological change is pretty exponential, and thats because the technological developement progress functions alot like a exponential function, here's many examples that shows  this;

How many changes did we make 2000 BC? There was probably 2 major inventions every 500 year.

Then step forward to around year 500 AC. We're probably seeing events that effect the technological developement every 100 year.

Now lets look at year 1500 AC. Events of technological increase have probably gone up to around every 50 year.

Lets take a step towards 1700 AC now. Oh boy this is where it starts to get really good. Steam engine is invented and the industrial age sets in, inventions are appearing everywhere, and ATLEAST every 10 year there are some event or invention that helps towards better technology.

Now look from just 1940-2000. How much happened in those 60 years.

More happened from 1940-2012 than have ever happened ever in the lifetime of mankind. 

Now let me try ot explain why technological developement is exponential.

A great example is the steam engine. It was a invention that helped with new inventions, these inventions then helped with even better inventions, and sped up technoligcal process. Now almost every year some technology is invented, that could potentially help invent some other technology. 

On top of all that hardware power is increased exponentially, and hardware is undeniable one of the most used things today, not to mention computers are helping scientist get better technology. 

Its very much just like a exponential function "
323,14,"I agree with your timelines, but I disagree that war is the only way to cause massive change in a society. Economics alone provides a strong enough incentive for new, disruptive technologies to be created, because such technologies are often very profitable.


The real issue is that our technology is inching closer and closer to what is theoretically possible according to the laws of physics, and as we approach these limits, the technology gets more and more complex, and consequently more and more difficult to refine, meaning that for any given type of invention, innovation gradually tapers off after a certain point. That's why, for example, commercial airplanes haven't changed much in the past couple of decades.

So, even as our world gets more technologically advanced, the technology we are inventing gets 'harder' to compensate."

328,14,"Regarding boron fusion:

Tri-Alpha is pretty close-lipped but targeting commercial boron fusion before 2020, and they've gotten $140 million from venture capitalists and Goldman Sachs.

Boron laser fusion needs a picosecond laser only six times bigger than our biggest now, and they're advancing rapidly. These lasers are fairly inexpensive and compact. A recent paper calculated that you could ignite  a block of uncompressed boron from the side, which means you only need one laser....a simple design with a huge energy gain.

Focus fusion has already achieved temperatures of 1.8 billion C, hot enough for boron fusion. Now they're ramping up the density and hope to get to breakeven conditions about a year from now. If they manage that, they expect it'd take five years and $50 million to get a production reactor. The reactor core is the size of a coffee can.

Polywell fusion people also talk about a five-year timeframe once they start building a full-scale reactor (2 meter for D-T, 3 meter for boron). Right now all the experiments are smaller, with the leading one probably in the U.S. Navy but those guys aren't talking much either. There was just a big academic conference about it too.

If we were stuck with tokamaks, then I would agree, more like 30 years for D-T and never for boron. "

334,14,"Inventions need to happen exponentially for things to change at a linear pace, because everything is getting more & more complex. I hope this will clear some things up. 

It's not as if I don't WANT things to change exponentially, but they just aren't, or at most, we're at the beginning of a curve. In any case, it will take many, many years for things to _really_ change. It might seem to go fast for personal gadgets such as mobile phones & computers, but in truth, these devices have gotten very limited extra functionality, except that they're a bit smaller, nicer looking, and their batteries now only last a day. If you zoom out and look at global change, then there's little. The roads are all still the same, as are the railways & the subways. It takes decades to build New York's Second Avenue Subway, for example. We're still flying in Boeing 747's, an aircraft designed in the late 60ties/70ties. Of the previous century. We haven't even been back to the moon. As a historian, I see things in a very broad perspective. The after-war boom of change is slowly coming to an end, and any major changes from now on will only come at a trickle, at best. I personally really don't care about the iPhone 5S, or the Playstation 4 and the Xbox 720. But those are probably the only major changes/innovations that we will get to actually SEE in the next 5 years.    "
335,14,"Society changes much slower though unless there is a pent up demand and the economics allow for it. I really think that something like 3D printing will require a 'killer app'.

Writing text is still done exactly the same way as 20 years ago. In 2020, you will be using a computer that's running Windows 20, and writing text using Office 20, with the same keyboard layout as I was using in 1990. Don't think that you won't be, because you probably will. From a random person's perspective in 2000 years, the computer's speed will be completely irrelevant."
337,14,"Your reasoning is entirely based on the fact that you don't actually KNOW anything from that time. Small advances in arrowhead design or hut-building seem trivial for us now, and may not have been recorded in history, but will have played a big role in the lives of the people from long gone ages. Actually LEARNING how to form a society, how to plant crops, how to tend to animals etc etc has been a process of invention, the same way that we are now 'inventing' the next steps in lithography. Getting wafers to produce at 22nm is a huge step for 'us', but do you really think that people in 2000 years will realize that? No way! They will just see the whole process of our automatization, and they will have zero understanding of all the small steps we had to go through.

Like I replied somewhere else: As society becomes more complex and our understanding of things becomes deeper, we need to invent at an  exponentional rate to keep up our linear growth. Once the steam engine was invented, it took 100 more years for humanity to master it, and we're STILL learning new things about it. "
338,14,"To be fair, thats probably because you didnt know much about how computers worked and their history of development. Their development has always been of an exponential sort and many people in the 50s even were predcting full blown AI by the 90s and 2000s. They were wrong about that of course but not by a whole lot. Consider things like IBM's Watson, Deep Blue and other computers able to out perform humans in complex tasks. 

Thats just computers and software though. With everything else change comes much slower and i do think people in this thread are a bit too optimistic. "
339,14,"In Florida ten years ago: (from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Constitution#High_speed_rail_amendment))

>On the November 5, 2000 general election, voters approved a citizens initiative referendum to amend the Florida Constitution to require the construction of a statewide high speed rail system connecting all of the state's major cities. The rail system would likely run alongside the state's interstate system, and would likely be similar to those found in Japan and other locales.

>However, in 2004, the amendment was removed from the constitution via another ballot referendum. Governor Jeb Bush and some other legislators pushed for the inclusion of the ballot item to remove the amendment, claiming the rail network would be too costly to build. Jeb Bush however claims that he is not opposed to the eventual construction of such a system, but that it should be managed by the Florida Department of Transportation. Proponents dispute the claim that the cost would be too high and say the presented cost estimates were highly exaggerated.



 TL:DR  We can't even get high speed rail up in this bitch. **We will never have maglevs**"
340,14,Are you out of your mind? 10 years ago I was 14 and just got my first high speed internet connection and it was pretty clear we were headed the direction of smart phones. There is absolutely nothing technologically impressive or surprising about smartphones; they are a logical continuation of where we were 20 years ago. And I was a lower middle class American. The changes you are suggesting are much different than that.

343,14,"Desalination is *very* energy intensive, so the larger the scale, the more energy that is required. Geothermal could work in areas that are highly geologically active, and possibly '[hot rock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhanced_geothermal_system)' technology everywhere else - though this may not be able to produce enough power.

There probably wouldn't be a risk to marine life since there is more water in the ocean than we could ever possibly need. There is a risk of increasing salinity though, but as long as the filtered salts were not placed back into the ocean, then it would be safe."
344,14,History always repeats itself!
345,14,"Yes and hats today are no better than hats 100 years ago. I think you're looking at industrial (and pre-industrial) technologies (e.g, roads) and comparing them to post-industrial technologies (e.g, computer, biotech). This is a false comparison.

Yes, we're still flying 747's which also why we can't extrapolate current technology to eventually reach a flying car. Of course we could start using quantum technology which would be a paradigm shift and that may eventually result in a flying car. In essence, you just can't improve the mechanics of a 747. The electronics have definitely improved and they're probably most computer controlled now. 

Roads and 747's aren't going to change your life though but IT and biotech will and they're on an exponential growth curve. I don't expect road and 747's  (at least mechanically) to be that much different in the future but that doesn't matter. Kurzweil talks about this. Everything that can be made into an information technology will be and will improve exponentially until it can't improved any longer.

Take the book. You could say, hey everything moves so slow, the book hasn't improved in 600 years since guttenberg - but wouldn't you be just missing the point. Now we have the equivalent of every book every published available at your fingertips with negligible cost to store. This has already happened. Sure publishers are still trudging along but they simply won't exist soon and are fast disappearing. They're obsolete. Movable type is obsolete after reigning for 600 years. In a couple of decades even if society hasn't caught up. The changes have already occurred and society will eventually change based on these developments but just b/c society doesn't look that different (b/c of vested interests in the old paradigm and other reactionary forces) doesn't mean that it isn't actually different. Entire media industries are obsolete. This will free up much power eventually but the change has already occurred and it's already over.

The iphone is better than the computer I bought 10 years ago and cost about half as much money but it's also much more efficient and tiny in comparison. You also must include not only raw power but also cost per unit of power. Things get faster, yes, but also smaller, more efficient and cheaper per unit of power and that enable even faster development of technologies. 

There was no genome industry at the consumer level 10 years ago. It seemed like scifi. Now there is an you can get your genome sequenced for a few thousand. Before this it took billions and decades just to sequence one human genome.

I have encountered the inability to understand exponential growth often. A few years ago I had an argument. There were two way to do something. One was much easier and less prone to error but slower but the part that made it slower was advancing exponentially. I said to do it the easy way and not worry about it b/c it will be a moot point in a couple of years. They didn't believe me b/c it was a noticeable difference at the time. Like the y2k problem. Well, a couple of years later the difference was moot. Yes, our road and planes aren't going to be that much better in 5 years but the part that is growing exponentially will. That is what will change your world."

So good to know that you've never had an illnesses requiring vaccination and no family history of Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and various cancers.  The rest of us are not so lucky and will take whatever a better understanding of the genome will toss at us.

>What has it changed? 

I imagine that for a woman who has early detection of a mutated BRCA1 it would change a great deal.  Or for a family aware that if they carry a fetus to term it will have Fragile X.

So you feel your misuse of technology and underlying mypoia is shared by everyone?  I use variably a non-standard keyboard layout to optimise my typing speed, voice recognition, motion tracking, EEG as a BCI, and touch screen.  I cannot say I was using them 20 years ago and given the way various technologies are expanding(functional ultrasound imaging, for example) I doubt I will have need to use them in 20 more.  Options are out there, people use them already, and many of them are growing in popularity.  Your views are not squared with reality.  And as processing power is scaled up and form factor is scaled down, we're seeing a steady increase of computers becoming ubiquitous in general devices.

Honestly, we've seen a lot of societal change over the past decade and even more over the past half decade thanks to advances in technology.  And the technology itself is growing by leaps and bounds further dragging society with it.  One would be hard pressed to have followed news of the past year without seeing various political uprisings around the globe.  Would you argue that these would have been carried out as successfully or at all without the technology enabling powerful social networking, privacy protecting, and knowledge dissemination?  Politicians in the US are particularly behind the curve on technology and look at how hard it has hit them the past two presidential elections.  They're cottoning on to the fact that when they say something, it will be known to all.  This is a new thing and is a direct result of cheap storage technology, recording technology, and data distribution technology.  To look at the past two decades and see no social change thanks to technology is to look back with blinders.

349,14,"I dont think you get it, there was so many reasons why there wasnt much done back 5000 years ago.

One thing was communication, people just didnt talk together, 1 tribe could know something that another tribe didnt know for centurys, and the other way around, information wasnt shared. The arrowhead maybe got invented over 100 years across the whole world because of no communication and no interaction with many other groups.

Thats just not how it is now. If technological improvements were the same now as they were just 2000 years ago, a computer chip would definetly not increase exponentially because people wouldnt talk shit together with eachother about each individuals little findings.

If the software on a computer was build the same style stuff was done 2000 years ago, there really wouldnt be many things on the pc other than the operating system, because software designers wouldnt get ideas from other software designers, and those designers wouldnt get ideas from any other software designers and so forth. I don't know any other way to explain it, 

but the base is that technology helps technology developement, which then helps the next technology developement goes faster, which means its **ACCELERATING** not decaccelerating, nor keeping the same speed. In a linear function the technology wouldnt assist further technology developement go faster.

**If a car is accelerating constantly, then its Time/Distance function is a exponential function. Just as if technology is accelerating its T/D function is a exponential function.**

Also to your example about that in 2000 years people wouldnt think a major invention now is significant, thats because they are technologically exponentially ahead of us, if it was linear however, then they would think the improvements we are experience now is just as big as the improvements they are experiencing then. So you kinda disproved yourself.

""No flying car/moon-base/robots"" are all very silly arguments as to why we WOULDNT have a exponential growth in technology. 

Moon base and flying cars are both inventions that has nothing to do with current technology not being exponential. Because flying cars are actually invented, they are just not being used because you would need a pilot license, and you would need to travel in specific routes, also what defines a flying car? Does it need to be without any wings at all and look exactly like a car just flying? Because then we are close to the magic dilemma, technologys that are so easy to think of, but scientifically just isn't possible for a very long time. Just because we thought a car that could fly, doesnt mean its something viable or even possible soon, just as we can think of a magic wand that can basically do anything, but doesnt mean its gonna be possible anytime soon.

One of the big change with IT is that the production cost is really low, all is in the conception. So it clearly encourages large scale services.

When the production cost is low we are encouraged to choose the best, what lead us to the monopolies and starification of many sectors (Khan Academy for education will lead to a massive concentration).

You can add the complexity of many engineering systems. No one can understand everything so we need hundreds of engineers on a project. When you work with an outside organisation you need standards, and standards are constraining innovation. Many companies do not want their product to be compatible with others.

Computer systems need to communicate and it is much easier when your company has all the data, sorted properly. Good luck to make a decentralized Facebook where anyone can have a different software that work within a standard.

Centralization make systems more stable unless everything collapses. Decentralized systems make everyone vulnerable but resilient to other people failures.

Even for solar panels centralization is great. Today, when we buy a panel half of the price is the installation cost and that will not go down that much. Installation and maintenance is much cheaper when you have a solar farm with hundreds of panels.

So many things that will make the world centralized."

China is already pouring billions of dollars into Thorium technology that the U.S started back in the 1960s.  Nothing else comes anywhere close to the energy density possible in nuclear power.  Solar and wind are not environmentally friendly when you start to realize that massive devastation is required to build the huge farms if you want them to support anything near 100% grid requirements.

371,15,I'll look at it.
372,15,"> Even for solar panels centralization is great. Today, when we buy a panel half of the price is the installation cost and that will not go down that much. Installation and maintenance is much cheaper when you have a solar farm with hundreds of panels.

On the other hand, centralization means higher vulnerability to cloud cover, the need for a higher overall capacity due to transmission, conversion, and locality losses, and a higher land use.  New buildings, built with integrated panels and wired for DC electricity, should lower costs.  Having the energy source integrated with the building also means it's easier to set and obey constraints.

>Computer systems need to communicate and it is much easier when your company has all the data, sorted properly. Good luck to make a decentralized Facebook where anyone can have a different software that work within a standard.

There's already a decentralized Facebook, called Diaspora, that works on a standard protocol but allows decentralized instances.  There are also plenty of ways for data to be efficiently decentralized, like Bittorrent, which as any pirate or Linux user knows is far more reliable and higher-performance than centralized direct downloads.

>You can add the complexity of many engineering systems. No one can understand everything so we need hundreds of engineers on a project. When you work with an outside organisation you need standards, and standards are constraining innovation.

Where do you get that idea?  We're using several of the most standardized and diverse technologies in history to post this comment.  Standardization is the single best form of centralization there is."
373,15,"> Super-large-scale agriculture is the only way to feed a growing population. Small scale farming (especially without phosphorus) simply can't make enough.

The problem right now is not production, it's distribution. Distributing production would solve that. Small-scale agriculture can be very productive as well; it just can't be automated very well. As for the phosporous, it's easier to set up local networks that compost and return feces and leftovers to the food chain locally, than to keep finding and mining phosphates and potassium and transport them around half the world; or to collect feces etc. to return them to the industrial agriculture production zones.

>The technology to work at home has existed for a long time. People simply prefer to meet each other in person. 

Correction: the boss prefers to survey his employees in person. As transport becomes more expensive, it will be allowed by corporate leadership when they accept the notion that it's a cost-saver.

>Is there actually a purpose to this? The power generated would be minuscule compared to solar panels.

The idea that it can be a stepping stone to cyborgs is probably what makes this idea attractive to the author. Quick-loading batteries would make this undesirable though.

>What leads you to this conclusion? The demand for resources can only go up. Nobody's going to stop mining or stop using modern large-scale, high tech mining equipment.

Ore concentrations are dwindling, energy prices are rising. At some point it will become easier to recycle garbage than pulverize rock.

"
374,15,">Super-large-scale agriculture is the only way to feed a growing population. Small scale farming (especially without phosphorus) simply can't make enough.

Large scale agriculture is not in the long term efficient. As an example consider the fact that plagues spread more easily. Similarly, costs of transportation are higher.

15-20% of worldwide energy needs; nuclear 2-3%. The rest fossil. There is not enough nuclear fuel available. We are already using more every year than we produce, relying on scrapped cold war nuclear weapons.

What does it matter if you still need to make do with ores that require massive mining projects... fueled by fossil fuels?

Why not pour money into improving renewables then, if we're going to call in expected technological gains? No commercial thorium design exists yet, there are some persistent problems that aren't solved yet. Money can't solve everything.

Initially Nucleus was going to just be an app that let you integrate all of your central services into a single central place, so that collaboration is easier. For /r/simulate it was getting cumbersome to have a reddit, Facebook page, forum, github, apps, blogs,and a wiki. The Nuclear part is the centralization of all the channels and platforms a project would need. That's how the name started.

However, in prospectus to the wider world, I was thinking about how different nuclear groups interact. In the physics example, small stable isotopes bond more often and hydrogen, the smallest unit is most reactive. Large radioactive isotopes become more degenerate as they get too large. (Big companies)

In the cell nucleus analogy, a healthy cell has a function, and all the cells in a higher organism collaborate for the bigger picture. If cells start replicating too uniformly and hoard resource, we call that cancer.

So that's the justification for the name, but I'm willing to change it while its still early.

That's common knowledge, indeed. Turns out common knowledge isn't always right:

389,15,"Let's learn how to do reliable spaceflight first instead of assuming we'll be able to do so, and in a way that's efficient, repeatable and expendable enough to make hauling rocks from space an economic proposition. We will certainly not be doing it in a few decades.

We have trouble getting to the *moon*."
390,15,What? No.  Natural gas is booming and will only become more dominant.
391,15,"What I'm talking about is vertical farming, or even small scale automated greenhouses. Growth can be much faster because you can optimize the nutritiens and pump it full of CO2. Getting enough CO2 fast enough is one of the limits to plant growth. Space can also be utilized much more efficiently. Currently growing stuff requires huge amounts of land, but you could stack things in the height instead of using just the area on the ground. You can also grow things off season, assuming you can get cheap enough electricity to power the LED-based grow lamps."

One of the current limitations though is that these systems could be more complete ecosystems to further utilize nature in things like recycling nutrients, but it should improve vastly the coming decades, especially when combined with coming robotics and automation technologies.

"
393,15,"First off, being a futurist requires making assumptions. The cost of space travel is dropping very quickly and the private space industry is happening fast. Look at the recent achievements of SpaceX. Robotics is also rapidly getting more advanced, so it is not a stretch that a fleet of robot miners can soon extract minerals autonomously. And since there is an INSANE amount of money to be made from the precious metals in space, there will be a huge push to make this happen as soon as possible. 10-15 is a fair estimate when factoring in the exponential growth of technology. "
394,15,"If natural gas is booming, why is oil still so expensive? There's plenty of substitution technically possible, but it's not happening because it's still not cheap.

Natural gas has limited supplies like any other fossil fuel. It may ramp up quickly, but that's because extraction speed is very high. Once a natural gas well stops giving as, it stops completely, whereas an oil well keep trickling for a while. So the boom now forebodes a bust rather soon thereafter."
395,15,"You're still only getting the same amount of sunlight. The area behind the tall building will be covered in shadow forever, which reduces its usability. It would only make sense in place where high-rise buildings are already common - but there those take away the light, so only on the top floors. Alternatively, in areas where light doesn't matter much, like industry zones, but do we really want to grow food in that air?

The biggest gains will probably be found in reducing the need for transport. But all the extra expenses (the building, utilities, machinery to operate, labor, ..) will need to be taken into account."
396,15,10-15 years is *extremely* optimistic.  The technology to go to Mars has existed for at least 25 years and yet here we are.
397,15,">First off, being a futurist requires making assumptions. The cost of space travel is dropping very quickly and the private space industry is happening fast. Look at the recent achievements of SpaceX.

The main problem is still time and space. Even just picking up an asteroid from past Mars (ignoring the mining for now) would require a huge, very risky expenditure of money and material. Worse, it would take a lot of time. So you have to discount the opportunity cost of not investing that capital on earth if you want to do it the commercial route. Either you expend a huge amount of energy to do the trip back and forth *fast*, or you take it slow. If you can harness that kind of energy it's probably more profitable to mine earth directly instead of importing asteroids.

So, bottom line: when we can afford to send out robots to map out the asteroid belt reliably, then we might consider trying to bring back something heavier than information. Until then, forget it. Try to put a robot factory on the moon first."
398,15,"Oil is expensive because of the artificial price-fixing and supply manipulation that goes on in OPEC.  It costs them roughly $2 per barrel to lift oil out of the ground and yet they sell it for ~$100.

Supply??  Are you kidding me?  LNG is so incredibly cheap right now because there are huge stockpiles sitting around not being used.  The price will rise as demand begins to balance out supply but that is nowhere close to the reason for the use of LNG not being more prolific.  Politics and infrastructure transformation are the real limiting factor.  Will there likely be a bubble and bust in LNG?  Probably as usually happens with any huge new industry like this.  Did the dot-com bust slow down the internet?  Barely. "
399,15,Explain what you mean by that
400,15,"I never said it would not be a large feat,  but we currently have most of the technology available to do it so 10-15 years isn't unreasonable for the economics to get there. A single asteroid can contain more platinum, gold, and other precious metals than has been mined in all of human history combined. The return would be worth many billions and cover the cost of the huge expense necessary to undertake such a task. There is literally unlimited valuable metals and resources in space so the incentive and return on the investment would be quite large. "
401,15,"There is no physical limit to dotcom startups. There is a physical limit to fossil energy.

Let's examine the ""OPEC pricefixing"" hypothesis. If there really is an abundant supply of energy, why doesn't it come to market? We've had the OPEC price shocks in the 70s. That's 40 years that we've had time to come up with a replacement from the - according to you - abundant supplies. You have to come up with wacky conspiracy theories to explain why the energy prices didn't come back down to the historical low in the 60's. 

My position is much simpler: there's nothing better available. That's why we have to drill for oil in the arctic, at the bottom of the sea; that's why we have to cause minor earthquakes in our search for the stuff."
402,15,"My point is that for you to say we're going to go from one (Japan's *Hayabusa*) sample return mission to a ""fleet of robot miners"" in 10-15 years is quite a stretch.  Politics and money have a talent for getting in the way of progress.  The technology for us to land on Mars existed back in the late '80s early '90s.  Look up Mars Direct and Mars Semi-Direct.  

However let's enter an amazing alternate reality where politicians have no power to influence the private space industry and see what happens.  I like SpaceX but there is a huge difference between launching something ~350 km above the earth and mining asteroids.

First SpaceX and it's competitors will have to design and build a launcher capable of sending a payload of substantial size to one of these asteroids.  That's probably going to be possible in roughly five years if falcon heavy and their reusability tech stays on schedule. 

Next Planetary Resources and it's counterparts are going to have to successfully land something for prospecting and testing purposes on an asteroid.  That will also likely be possible in ~10 years.  Next they have to figure out if they want to mine on site or tow back to LEO.  That's another mission or two.  Tack on another 5 years.  Next they have to demonstrate the ability to extract and either process or transport resources. 3 Years here is generous, 5 years is more likely.  At this point in the timeline bringing back a few pounds of asteroid rocks to earth will be a major victory.  Moving from that point to developing a large scale operation like you describe is too hard to predict, another 5 years minimum to 10-20 years maximum.

So no we will not be trucking back massive quantities of REE to our factories on earth in 15 years.  Is it possible we will be capable of processing small amounts into fuel for our craft already in space?  Maybe.  Planetary resources and companies like them are in this for the long game.  They have to develop completely new technology and we have no idea what that will look like.  They will likely move from a position as a supporter of other space endeavors with the ability to obtain resources in space (something that is extremely lucrative) to eventually delivering material to Earth's surface.  I'm all for optimism but not at the cost of reality.  

Space is *hard.*  You can't jump from SpaceX docking with the ISS to Star Trek in 10 years.  SpaceX was founded in 2002.  It still took them near bankruptcy and ten years to do something we've been able to do since the 1960s.  We're not going to be able to simply hop on their rocket grab a couple asteroid rocks and come back billionaires.  Hopefully by 2025 we'll be capable of extracting water and methane for uses in space but anything beyond that I find highly unlikely in the short term.  No I'm not an industry insider but I am basing these opinions off spaceflight as we know it so far."
403,15,">   but we currently have most of the technology available

I honestly do not see that. Getting a tiny robot on Mars is with a one-way-trip so hard that it fills the newspaper headlines for years. How are we going to get an industrial mining facility even further, let alone make it return... *with* payload?

>A single asteroid can contain more platinum, gold, and other precious metals than has been mined in all of human history combined.

Can, or will? It's much more likely to have a similar composition as earth, Mars and the moon. It's possible that we win the cosmic lottery, but as long as you don't have several candidates mapped it out, on one will risk it.

>The return would be worth many billions and cover the cost of the huge expense necessary to undertake such a task.

Accounting for the opportunity costs of the large amount of time needed *and* the high risk involved (nothing like it has been done before), I honestly don't see anyone gambling that much money.

>There is literally unlimited valuable metals and resources in space so the incentive and return on the investment would be quite large.

There is practically unlimited methane on Titan, but since it would cost more energy to haul it to here than combusting it would deliver, it's worthless."
404,15,">There is no physical limit to dotcom startups. There is a physical limit to fossil energy.

What does that even mean?  You're completely ignoring economics 101.  Markets are determined by supply and demand.  If there was no limit to dot.com start-ups then we never would have had a crash.  Market saturation has and will continue to be a limiting factor for profitable business.  The only difference is that in the digital world the entry barriers are lower.  If demand is down supply goes down.  If demand goes up supply goes up.  If demand goes up but supply doesn't go up, **price goes up.**  This is where monopolies and oligopolies find their power.

The reason we need to leave fossil fuels behind is not because we are about to run out, that is still at least a hundred years away.  We need to transition to something else because of the environmental destruction our extraction and use of it causes.  

**Edit:** Not to be rude but when you demonstrate complete ignorance on a topic no rational person is going to continue listening to your arguments.  Study the history of Saudi Arabia, it's fascinating.  I'm excited for a world that is no longer dependent of OPEC for it's oil.

"
405,15,"Ok so factor in the nonlinear acceleration of technology and a high economic push, 10-20 year time frame is fair. Everything you say is valid and it does not even seem like we are actually disagreeing about much. The future happens in unexpected way very quickly. No doubt space is incredibly challenging but it has been around since the 50's, and things are gearing to change. Computers were around for a long time but were expensive and did not make money. But the money is what drives innovation and once a single asteroid is mined, it will explode and change the global currency of metals. When it is done once, even in small scale, the world will realize that the resources from space are infinite and there will be a big push. You seem very knowledgable and everyone is entitled to opinions since there is no way of truly being able to predict future events but it's just some food for thought. "
406,15,"> What does that even mean? You're completely ignoring economics 101.

The amount of fossil fuels in AD 0 was fixed, a limited quantity. The only question is how fast and how much we're going to extract. At some point the easy pickings are gone and it's generally downhill from there... no matter how high demand gets.

>Regarding your comment on OPEC price fixing being a ""wacky conspiracy theory"" I can think of no more fitting response than this video.

Of course OPEC tries to do price fixing; that's what a cartel is for. The wacky part of your claim is that you claim that fossil fuels are abundant, and yet OPEC *succeeds* in price fixing. OPEC is a limited group of states, after all, and they only control a small part of the world. If they can control the price, that means the rest of the world *can't* fill the demand, and therefore fossil fuels are not abundant and limited by geology rather than societal factors like politics or economics.

>The reason we need to leave fossil fuels behind is not because we are about to run out, that is still at least a hundred years away. We need to transition to something else because of the environmental destruction our extraction and use of it causes.

I definitely agree that that alone is more than sufficient a reason to start moving away.

>Not to be rude but when you demonstrate complete ignorance on a topic

Whether I'm ignorant or not, it certainly isn't going to help to call me ignorant.

> Study the history of Saudi Arabia, it's fascinating. I'm excited for a world that is no longer dependent of OPEC for it's oil.

You can't claim there's plenty of oil *and* that we depend on OPEC for our supply. The OPEC surely is fascinating. Export quota are determined by total reserves; that means that its members are driven to to overreport their known reserves, so they can export more.."

Now, I love my mom, even though she is difficult and far beyond seeing all the wrong with her ""logic"", but she is not the point here, and this is not an anti-religion rant (I am an atheist, however). The point is, she is far, far from unique. She is only one of fucking *millions* of held back, ultra terrified-of-change people, who will verbally if not physically fight and hold human progress back.

For every futurist, there is a thousand traditional humans. For every willing transhuman, there are a thousand Christians who believe it is wrong, that the ""soul"" will not survive the transfer. For every open eye, there are a thousand clenched shut.

How well prepared is the general population? I ask you: which demographic? This is not a black and white question with a black or white answer; there are people who have never had electricity in their home, and on the other side of the planet there are people willing to move their living brain into a post-bio body. If you ask the average Kenyan, ""are you ready for the singularity?"", his answer will be so far different from that of the average Syrian, who likely just wants some form of peace.

Further different still would be the answer of the pacified, comfortable, ""safe"" Caucasian, who fears neither death nor hunger (unlike a country with war on their home land, I mean no offense). 

So the answer to your question ""For that matter, how well prepared are we?"" - the answer is a resounding ""we have no other choice"". The future will come whether we want it to or not, and it's contents are of our own making. Is the public ready? No, it never will be. But they will adapt, something our young little species is incredibly good at. We will adapt."
409,16,"A sort of interesting corollary question is how many futurologists are aware of the past. I think there is a general focus on the whiz-bang technological improvements but relatively little understanding of how human societies adapt to these gains. The big changes will need to come in the social arena. Sure, technologies can force some changes but things would go smoother with a better understanding of psychology and history.

The main reason I mention this is because you brought up 3d printing of guns, a story that I think is overhyped. First of all, you can currently build a gun yourself and people have been making guns for hundreds of years. The 3d printers are just printing the lower receiver, so you would still need to buy or fabricate the barrel and chamber. While I appreciate the opportunities 3d printing can bring, I think many overlook the problems and challenges that come with it. Even 2d printers have tendencies to jam, managing color accuracy is a huge business and an art in itself, maintaining straight margins can be a chore, etc. We also ignore the fact that machining tools have been doing the most of the same things 3d printing aspires to do, only better, and for decades.

Since you work in tech this should be a familiar pattern. ""What's old is new again."" Witness the various ebbs and flows to thin servers, language choices and so on. A large part of the problem is that many people working on ""new"" approaches are actually unaware of the trials and tribulations that went on before them. Before you can accurately understand what the future holds, you have to understand the past. Some people have a hard time even coming to grips with what is going on in the present."
410,16,"Every time I mention I've structured my career plans over the rise of useful AI and cheap robotic labour, people look at me like I'm completely insane.  Self driving cars seem a fantasy to them, and any mention of body/genetic modification or brain machine interfaces just brings on looks of fear or disgust.  I can't count the number of times after Lance Armstrong got caught I had to point out that gene mods are less than a decade away, once again to looks of ""whatever shut up nerd."" 

No, most people have no idea what the fuck is going on.  They have no idea both how much our world is soon going to change, and how much of that change has already occurred or is occurring right now."
411,16,"This is a good conversation topic for this subreddit, and I wish more people would chime in with their opinions. 

To answer the question though, a lot of people do not think about it at all. Most do not know of what is coming around the corner even.
The other day I mentioned the idea of a space elevator to some friends and they had never heard of it and thought I was crazy. (not that I think one is going to be built any time soon, but will happen eventually) 


 When the truly fantastical things start showing up we might find that developing countries adopt new tech faster than developed ones. Kind of like the cell phone, many countries are skipping computers and going right to internet through the cell phone network.

413,16,"Most people snicker at the projections I try to make of what we'll be capable of doing as far as taking simple electronics that we are accustomed to and then just extrapolating it only 30 years out.

we can only hope that word of mouth and the access to the internet will keep corporate entities weary of the unsavory practices that they're so accustomed to, *like slowly releasing techology, that was already possible in the first gen, on later generations...* ***example: not having a camera in the first gen iPad...***"

415,16,Your question tends to answer itself by the way you've phrased it.
416,16,"I think many people in our society who could have daily access to futurist topics only really think short term. These people are mostly worried about and/or interested in the most popular (political) news topics at hand and only for a short period of time. So, when a futurist topic is brought up they may think it's a strange idea, or a cool thought, or whatever else but in the end they really don't care because they don't see it as something that will effect them anytime soon, if at all."
417,16,"TBH, I don't think that even most futurist are prepared for The Singularity/End of Time.  Some are, some will get ready in the years leading up to it, but I think the vast majority of people familiar with futurist works, myself probably included, are not truly prepared for, let alone understand, The Singularity.  Its akin to saying that we are prepared for mass contact with an extra~~terrestrial~~Dimensional entity."
418,16,"All i can say is that in the future there will be a ton of discrimination against people who dont go with the tech and get implants/gene modifications. Not much a normal human can do to compete with a ""enhanced"" human who is literally smarter, faster and stronger than everyone else. someone who gets work done by ""thinking"" it is going to get stuff done a whole lot faster than those who have to manually input stuff.

Soon though, religion as we know it now will cease to exist. There is no room for a god in a world where humans can be created without flaws by other humans."
419,16,Agreed. I meet people that live in the past on daily basis.
420,16,That's a good point. I tend to be a bit skewed in my perceptions of the adoption of technology myself. I work in tech in a 1st world country. I'm fairly floored when I see someone that I thought was relatively current pull out a flip phone.

In just the ways that you've described, though the case with your mom is certainly rather severe, the adjustments of society already are.

The idea of plugging in to a better world is likely going to cause some friction, even with my wife who is pretty with it."
423,16,"I just want to chime in, because of an interesting contrast. 

You see, my mother is nearly opposite yours in every way. She is devout athiest, so convinced of her stance that discussing religion is an exercise in frustration. (I am neither an atheist nor religious) 

She is also a very left leaning, Marxist/socialist person. 

Now, with her liberal nature it might seem like she would be open to technology. However, she is also a fierce organic/if it isn't 100% natural it is going to kill me type of person. She definitely fears technology. Anything tech that is medical, agricultural or any human modification are creepy and unnatural to her. She won't even use OTC pain killers or go to a doctor in most cases. 

I guess my point is that fear and resistance to technology is going to found among a great variety of people. 

This doesn't mean that people won't change. Some few will always resist, but tech can be gradually introduced so that the changes are smaller and the future arrives unnoticed by the majority who would have once feared it. 

We are constantly changing and most people, not seeing that the future is here are afraid of it, but they still don't notice the change. It is hard to imagine where we were 10 years ago.. it defies belief. Society is simultaneously unprepared for the future and unaware when it arrives. "
424,16,"It's not quite as bad as it seems.  Many people tend to fear ""the next thing"" or ""the technology that doesn't quite exist yet"", but for most people that quickly goes away once the new technology suddenly becomes normal.   The people who in 1980 were talking about how the internet was a freaky government conspiracy now use the internet every day, and they probably don't even remember that they used to think it was scary.  The people who are flipping out about google glass right now will be using it in 5 years."
425,16,"""For every futurist, there is a thousand traditional humans"" - it's not as bad as that. 

Trendspotters generally reckon that extreme early adopters (which is the bracket that I would guess most transhumanists fall into) and extreme resisters (flat-out luddites) make up about the same proportion of the population (about 1% each): most of every population will take up the new if they can see that it benefits them, but will take different amounts of time to get round to it.  
"
426,16,"You know, I think that your largely right in that the religious fundamentalists do not have an understanding of the futurist concepts.  However, I think that it doesn't hurt to think about the singularity in religious terms whether or not you believe in any sort of ""higher powers""

Have you ever looked into mystic/religious/occult prophesies in terms of the technological singularity?  

I know that this subreddit, like reddit as a whole tends to avoid these subjects but, I mean Newtons prediction of the end of times based off biblical prophesies (2060) is pretty close to Kurzwiels (2045).  "

THAT BEING SAID, I don't think a person will be able to remain religious after having their conscious implanted into an upgradeable, non biological piece of hardware. Intelligence, or how ""smart"" someone is, I believe to be based on synapses (how fast their actual, meat based brain is), blood flow, etc.

With a non-organic brain, your ""intellect"" will be limited by things such as storage space, speed, time - not how well your frontal lobe developed during your mothers ""pregnant drinking phase"". With a technically unlimited ability for thought and understanding, I think it would be mere minutes before a person understood where religion belongs."

450,16,"That is a possibility.  We need to be politically active, and support pro-science and pro-futuristic candidates against knee-jerk conservatives and anti-science types.

The point of biggest danger, I think, is when a technology is almost here; it's real enough to be ""scary"" but doesn't actually exist yet except hypothetically.  This is why Republicans in the US were able to successfully stop stem cell research for most of a decade, was because it was ""scary"" but because the benefits of the new technology weren't visible yet.  

We may have similar fights over a number of other new technologies; genetic modification, life extension, ect.  But it's a temporary stage; people's minds seem to change once they see the real benefits of the new technology.  "
451,16,"I'm not really very religious, and I don't really know anything for sure.  What I do believe to be true is that consciousness exists (""I AM"" is the shortest definition I offer but another one I like is awareness of oneself and ones environment), and math exists/works.  The two are related somehow, I think, maybe.  You do seem to have a religion though, known to most as materialism, and it is the belief that an objective material universe exists.  I think this provides useful insights.  

However, the converse can also provide useful insights.  The converse is that the universe is subjective and no reality exists outside of the conscious observer.  Its basically whether consciousness is made of matter or matter is ""made of"" consciousness.  Maybe both?  I guess the main point is not to write off a huge area of human knowledge because of what some wacko Fundamentalist christian has been taught.  It is important also, to look at The Singularity from both perspectives.  I fight for The Singularity to come from a place of Love and Peace.  [Jason Silva](http://knowyourmeme.com/blog/qa-with-futurist-jason-silva--2) has some good insights into that area, as do the people he references like Timothy Leary, [Terence McKenna](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhIJJMV8BsA), and [Robert Anton Wilson](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ekkn4icBL8)

Might also be difficult to fully automate due to the mixture of specific physical tweaks and logical problem solving.

To completely automate the job, you would need both a robot that could manipulate components / move about the work space as quickly as a human, plus an algorithm that could identify common network problems and task its minions accordingly (plus know how to google annoying problems and properly utilize what it finds).  It will probably be done eventually, but I'm hoping I can at least get some experience in the filed before my job is phased out - hopefully gaining some references I could use when adopting a new career.

Many transhumansist are known for having a ""contempt for flesh,"" which I assume would include more than our own. Please excuse me for saying so, but a caveman's diet shouldn't be cited as a healthy or sustainable means of supporting tens of billions of people. Would you also argue that leather is best for a moonsuit? Shall we line our space station quarters with fur? That's what we were ""meant"" to wear, right? And how does such a diet compliment many futurists' yearning for eternal life? As I touched on above, [recent studies](http://www.therecord.com/living/healthfitness/article/850393--the-new-vegetarians-are-in-it-for-their-health) are showing that even the *healthiest* omnivore diets are [scoring lower than that of vegans](http://nutritionfacts.org/video/vegetarians-versus-healthy-omnivores/) in tests of longevity. Animal products increases the risk of cancer; [this is a fact](http://www.pcrm.org/pdfs/health/cancer/meat_and_cancer.pdf).

What? I don't understand how that follows logically, at all. Either way... I never claimed that it is the most sustainable diet for a planet of eaters, I claim that it is the most appropriate diet for the human body. 

Studies showing higher longevity in vegetarians, even if they are accurate- have little relevance to me. In the same way that a calorie restricted diet would score higher in longevity, that doesn't mean it is optimal for my body or my lifestyle in particular. Same thing goes for potentially higher cancer rates, just because meat could increase the risk of cancer does not mean that it isn't the optimal thing for my body to be consuming. Imagine that you could lower the risk of a certain malfunction in your car if you avoided a particular fuel or additive- that does not mean that the car was not intended to run on that fuel or additive or that you should avoid it. I hope you can see the distinction I'm making here. 

>If you might argue that a paleo diet exceeds in nutrition, based on its ""natural"" appeal, then you must thereby throw every technological advancement of the past 200 years out the window.

I find it disheartening that this logic makes sense to you. I don't believe that a paleo diet is optimal because it is natural, it is what the machine that is our body was developed to consume. There's no appeal to nature here, I'm a transhumanist. "

Despite all being 20/30-something leftists, a group of people just railed on me for all they were worth and kept asking the same questions I've been asked a thousand times over the years (don't you miss _____?) and saying things like ""okay then, for every animal you don't eat, I'll eat three!"" 

I really wish the stigma would end. I never get on people's backs for eating meat but I guess it's the price one inevitably pays for taking a different path in life. I also keep all my obsessions about futurism, The Singularity, robotics, VR, etc. away from all but my closest friends and Reddit because I know I'd get ridiculed for that too. "

490,17,"> I never claimed that it is the most sustainable diet for a planet of eaters, I claim that it is the most appropriate diet for the human body.

> Imagine that you could lower the risk of a certain malfunction in your car if you avoided a particular fuel or additive- that does not mean that the car was not intended to run on that fuel or additive or that you should avoid it. I hope you can see the distinction I'm making here.

Even though you denied it, you are arguing with an appeal to nature. The truth is, no one knows what the perfect diet for the human body is -- even if there is one -- but recent studies are beginning to prove that veganism is *better* than any others. (I cited several sources in my post above.) And to take your very example of the automobile: we own a 2002 Jetta TDI that was *intended* to run on 100% ULSD. We have been running a 50% blend of biodiesel for over a year and have seen an increase in fuel economy, reduced emissions, and a quieter engine. If you're saying that such evidence should be ignored, based upon the ""recommended specifications for human existence"" then you are willfully denying that which could save your life. Why wash your hands? We were not ""meant"" to be purging ourselves of bacteria several times a day, so why not welcome disease? Improving the human experience and advancing to that which might lie beyond our perceived limitations *is at the very heart of transhumanism.* A paleo diet is a step backward!

*Transhumanist philosophers argue that there not only exists a perfectionist ethical imperative for humans to strive for progress and improvement of the human condition but that it is possible and desirable for humanity to enter a transhuman phase of existence, in which humans are in control of their own evolution. In such a phase, natural evolution would be replaced with deliberate change.*

A vegan diet, being so hard to successfully maintain in the ""wild"" is a perfect example of deliberate and rewarding change. Like biodiesel in my fuel tank. 

Also, [abolitionism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abolitionism_(bioethics) -- which is a current of veganism *and* transhumanism -- is directly opposed to the exploitation of animals. [The IEET's take on the matter](http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/RNHP).

Almost all of the states are fighting and lobbying congress to get their state to win one of the test sites because it will draw an enormous amount of energy and investment to their state.  One of the guys who actually got permission after a few years of painstaking work with the FAA was only allowed to fly around way up north of Alaska.  It was the first commercial UAS flight ever.  Insitu is the company I am talking about.  Its owned by Boeing.  There are no rules by the FAA even being written yet....  My best guess when it finally does come around is that it will hit the cargo side first because boxes don't care if there is a pilot up front.

That wouldn't kill off farming on its own, since there's also biofuel. We'll need either great electric cars, and/or synthetic hydrocarbons generated using non-carbon energy sources and CO2 concentrated from the air.

If we use renewables for energy, we'll still use a lot of land. Nuclear sources like advanced fission or fusion would do better. If we manage boron fusion, we'll make the transition very quickly, since it'd likely be ten times cheaper than everything else.

Meanwhile, urbanization is an ongoing trend almost everywhere, so if all that land stops being productive, I think we'll probably leave it alone. If a lot of farmland turns back into forest and prairie, that'd not only be great for biodiversity, it'd pull a lot of carbon out of the atmosphere."
611,21,"The way you talk about ""nature"" makes it sound like you're asking how much space will we take up as technology progresses. I think the answer is the same fate for any form of ""nature"" though. In the industrial revolution, we automatized production and grew like crazy. Transportation, manufacturing, communication, and more all became easier to deploy. However, more recent technology is now inspecting the efficiency of what we've created. We've realized energy isn't limitless. Cars need to use less fuel, factories need to be multi-functional, and buildings need to build up not out. I think technology is integrating into nature to work efficiently within the confounds we are naturally given."

613,21,"Socioeconomical model is becoming increasingly incompatible with our technology though. Automation has killed most unskilled jobs, and is making a go at skilled ones.

Those lost jobs mean that many people have no money (resources) to spend (trade). Without these people spending money on things, money won't flow back to employers effectively. 

Instead, the funds that would have been used to pay those employees turns into profit that will likely be used to pay dividends to stockholders, or to line pockets of executives. This money will wind up effectively frozen.

Current model needs adjustment to prevent automation from causing resources to concentrate like they are now."

It's going to take time and process to teach an AI to communicate with the various systems in place, and teach it to translate outputs from one system into inputs for another. A person will be required to learn the various processes in a business or organization, and then to train the AI to fulfill those processes. Every business is different, and this will rarely be the exact same each time, although I suspect as more businesses are AI-integrated, the faster the training will go, as there will be a larger data pool to draw experience from."
624,22,"A business has an operational model that is a rough pyramid going from:

- The Executive Suite: designs and manages the business model
- Marketing: acquires, retains and engages with potential customers
- Research and development: creates and improves products for the customers marketing delivers
- Sales and customer service: negotiates and supports customer leads
- Production: makes and delivers the product to the customer
- Administration: services internal company demand (ex: secretaries, accountants, etc)

Technology has all but eliminated administrative tasks that could be eliminated, shoving a personal secretary into a smartphone and accountants into the cloud.

Production work is also highly automated and more automation is coming, as machines gain better cognition of the real world they can go out into it instead of working on a controlled assembly line.

Sales and customer service, on the other hand, benefits from human empathy and, as companies realize more savings in production and administration, they will afford to spend more on their sales force to offer an overall better experience.

Research and development is already a huge industry, and what we call venture capital is a massive network of research and development projects into new business models that may or may not get traction with customers. Any company that is not investing more in research and development is slowly being buried by new products from other companies.

Marketing will be the #1 job creator of the next fifty years, since every consumer will be so solicited by new products that an increasingly expensive system will emerge to get them to pay attention to a new value proposition. Much like there is no limit to the budget of a summer blockbuster movie, there is no limit to how much can be spent on a marketing campaign to get people to drink coke and enjoy it more. Expect increasingly fanciful marketing vehicles competing with one another for your attention. Afterall, Mr. Pewdiepie and pro-gamer leagues have no economic value other than to get you to listen to sponsors for a few seconds.

Executives will keep making even larger fortunes, as globalization increases the scale of businesses further and makes the stakes even higher for shareholders, who will not balk at spending a fortune on A-league executives.

In conclusion, if you think your job threatened today, ask yourself: are your skills useful in sales, research and development, or marketing? If not, you are in for a decline in your status."

631,22,"Well, youtube content creators would be a bad example of a new job. In fact, that's simply existing jobs on a new medium. Yes, there are a few of them who make a living at it, but most youtube content creators don't. They have jobs, and simply supplement their income. There are very few jobs that exist today that didn't 30 years ago, although there are some jobs that are old jobs, now performed on the Internet. 

There are very, very few new jobs coming that we can predict. Crypto currency bankers for example is highly unlikely to become a job, precisely because crypto currency is designed not to need a bank. VR developers are video game developers with an upgrade in the tech used, not a new job. pro e-athletes might be a niche for a bit, but they will occupy the same kind of numbers as any other form of pro athlete. The people who have a natural gift and spend years developing that gift will be the ones that matter, and the number will likely be in the hundreds to low thousands worldwide. Not enough to matter. Lawyers are already being automated away, and the people who try to regulate crypt currency will be the same people who currently regulate currency. None of these are likely to create any amount of new jobs.

Having a human optimize drone traffic is insane. Computers are reaching the point where they will be better at this kind of task. VR Tour Guides are probably not going to amount to any numbers at all, as you can actually automate the hell out of that, and will at most be a tiny niche. 4D printing engineers will basically be replaced by robots in a decade, as will transhuman surgeons. Genetic engineers are actually something that exists today, but every year the tech is better, and we need less of them to do more. Simulation specialists will be software, and so will artificial meat designers (in the very near future). Actually, every single one of these jobs is likely to be given predominantly to software/hardware. It is highly unlikely that a single job you have in your list will amount to more than a few people.

One thing that I think I'm trying to point out by saying this is that we can not tell for sure that humanity will go in this direction, we might use some, most, or all of the influences of this concept, but definitely we will have a clustered use of technologies used to apply to sustainable living.

There are a lot of different things that affect that. From waste recycling to more efficient and localized production of energy and resources. That's one of the reasons that the Arcology concept posits that the hyperstructures are self sufficient. The food, energy, and resources are all produced and consumed locally.

Even without bringing the hyperstructure concept into the picture imagine how far we could reduce the footprint if we consolidated energy, food, and materials production within each city area by using many of the same concepts and reducing travel requirements? 

That alone would substantially reduce the conceptual footprint of each human in the chain.

but the population is only rising in those areas where there is not a strong middle class. The solution to population growth, surprisingly lies in making people prosperous. 

Hans Rosling talks about this quite a bit, with current extrapolation (unless there's new information I don't know) putting the world eventually at about 10 billion (mostly due to longer lives and less infant mortality counteracting the fact there are far fewer children being born), with a steady equilibrium after that for some time.

659,25,"With respect to firearms, I suspect that they will still be broadly distributed and widely available for purchase.  Simply put, there are already huge numbers of guns in the hands of private citizens, and they're both durable and cheap/easy to maintain.  Furthermore, gun ownership is deeply ingrained in the psyches of many Americans, and it would seem unlikely that this will change, since many gun owners actively involve their children in their gun-related activities (e.g. hunting, target shooting, etc.) from an early age.

However, I think we will see two very important shifts in the next few decades.  

First, as we become more comfortable and accustomed to large amounts of our personal data being stored, tracked, and made available to others, resistance to things like mandatory background checks and such will wither.  As a result, guns will be very, very hard to (legally) get ahold of for convicted felons or people with histories of mental illness.  Even illegal access will be at least somewhat more restricted, as the government begins cracking down on firearms dealers who consistently allow straw-man purchases and other violations of existing regulations (all made much more visible by robust and omnipresent tracking of data).

The second shift will be the development and proliferation of less-than-lethal weapons for self-defense.  For example, ranged tasers are relatively new, and technologically speaking somewhat primitive - there's bound to be tremendous improvement in their efficiency and effectiveness over the next few decades.  The increased performance of these weapon systems will make them gradually more appealing to consumers (and LEOs) who might otherwise choose to buy traditional firearms."

669,25,"I won't go much into whether or not power is currently centralized unless you would like me to.  I'll simply point out that the federal government is more involved in providing services that used to be provided by state and local governments than they've ever been.  That isn't to say that state and local governments *aren't* providing services, because they surely are, just that the number of federal programs has vastly increased over the last 80 years while those offered more locally have stayed about the same.  Again, I can go into more detail on this, but I suspect you would agree that power is now more centralized than it has ever been in the U.S.

If we can agree on this point, then the natural question to ask is whether such centralization is sustainable.  I suggest it is not simply because of 30 or more years of bipartisan choices to grow the national debt at a rate higher than GDP growth.

At present, the federal debt to GDP ratio is right around 100%.  That might be something we could work with if we weren't running a budget 40% deficit **and** if we didn't have our largest generation retiring and consuming more federal services (Social Security and Medicare, particularly).

Someone might say, ""So?  Bond rates are at historical lows!""

That's the problem.  At some point, bond rates will increase.  Despite the Federal Reserve's ""Operation Twist"" to sell off short term treasuries and buy longer term bonds, the problem still remains that federal debt has a fairly low maturity.  In other words, when the inevitable happens and bond rates rise, the portion of the federal budget that goes towards interest on the debt will consume a larger and larger slice of the pie.  There are only three moves for the federal government at that point:

1. Increase revenue.  The problem here is that they have never been able to caption more than 20% of GDP, regardless of top income tax rates, so there is a real limit on this.

2. Print money.  This only works for so long.  There's nothing magical about the U.S. that protects it from hyperinflation should the Fed continue to finance the debt.

3. Cut services.  This is the only thing left after all other options are tried, and the only way to actually balance the budget.

Once step 3 is reached, that marks the point of reversal for centralization."

While all of the various amino acids may be found in different plant sources, eating animals as your protein source ensures that you do not become deficient in any of the amino acids that have been determined to be essential to healthy human function.

There's some disagreement, and I'm always open to alternate views, but the necessity of my own health requires that I stick with the consensus for the most part.

That being said, I still rarely eat meat and get my protein from a couple of different sources to cover my bases."

I'm mostly vegan at the moment anyways, I just choose not to resist things like bacon when the fancy suits me. I feel like that's the best way to do it anyways."
696,26,"There are complete proteins that are plant foods: quinoa, soy, buckwheat, hempseed, rice & beans if you want to count that.

Generally that's when I'm eating out socially, I haven't had meat or eggs in my home since probably Christmas. And I do eat a variety of things to make sure that I'm getting a rounded diet.

702,26,"Well you know what they say.. you are what you eat


Lawl no just kidding. But that's crazy though, why are you a vegan? do you choose not to eat meat or can you not do it?"
703,26,"Well that's not very healthy, well rounded or balanced. Eat some veggies."
704,26,"Yes, and I forgot that there are some complete protein plant sources. Not everyone has my limitations in terms of carb restriction, plus a lot of grains make my insides feel bad. I tend to willfully ignore lots of things that I know I can't eat myself. Stupid cognitive bias."
705,26,Probably the same place I got the idea that hempseed is full of THC. AKA I was at work and didn't check. This conversation has gone poorly for me lol.
706,26,"I'm not vegan, I'm mostly vegan. I don't generally make binary decisions. I can still help reduce the suffering of animals and the environmental impact of livestock farming by reducing my meat intake. Do I eat hamburgers sometimes? Yes. Is it better to eat them once in a while instead of every day? I think so. If I don't do something 100%, does that mean I've wasted my efforts? I don't believe that."
707,26,"I do? I just said it's mostly nuts. I eat lots of greens and herbs and some certain seeds. And nuts cover a lot of things, I eat a fair amount of coconut too. Some fruit, but less than most. Low carb isn't no carb."
708,26,lol it's all good. 
709,26,"Also, just FYI, you need to consume a very large amount of soy to experience any effects from the phytoestrogens. Like, if you eat a soy-based meal three times a day every day. "
710,27,"Strange they didn't post the link. [Here it is](http://bistro-invitro.com/en/welcome-to-bistro-in-vitro/).

What I never understood was why they didn't focus on replicating really expensive meats. If they can eventually control the texture completely, why not try replicating [kobe beef](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobe_beef) which costs $180 per kg. 

Just like Tesla started with the luxury market, and then cheaper electrics like Nissan Leaf appeared, why not compete with the expensive stuff instead of the regular burgers?"
711,27,My hope is that they'll make the meat taste good instead of imitating the tasteless crap that the factory farms produce today.
712,27,I can't be the only one not interested in eating this stuff. 
713,27,There will always be a market for real meat and always a fine restaurant to make it for people.
714,27,"This is why (one of the reasons) that I didn't like the book.Oryx and Crake. Replacing the disgusting and inhumane factory farm with meat grown without sentience destined or slaughter is just fine. Also, why would chikinubs be any blander than Mickey D's is now?"
715,27,"Highly unlikely that the costs of lab-grown meat will ever come down enough. The masses of the population in the future will be eating a variety of foods made from algae. Tastes better than corpses, much healthier, less expensive.

You know all that carbon in the atmosphere that's killing life on this planet? It will be removed by algae, and turned into fuels and simple sugars, as well as carbon in various forms for building materials."
716,27,"I don't think they can make fat yet. I feel like the ability to completely scan and replicate things like kobe beef or lamb from a certain area will probably happen one day, but it will have to be through different methods. 
"
717,27,"If it didn't have a face, I don't want it."
718,27,"Though it may end up being a luxury if this method of making meat were to take off fully in the future (If it was cheaper, and less time consuming than growing a cow), surely natural meat would be much less produced.  
Unlikely it would vanish, but certainly not be that big of a market. Specially as time goes by after the change occurs. People that grew in a time where the grown meat is a common thing (And presumably tastes like real meat, if not, I dont see how it beat natural), they may see no point in natural.

Sort of how when cars came out many said horses would always have a spot, and many stuck with them for the rest of their lives, because cars were 'change' and we dont like change.

It could be that eventually they would see 'only eat natural meat' people funny. (If someone told you they only used horses for transport, or only candles for light, wouldnt you?)

This has happened so many times, I am sure it will be like this.  The change from geocentric to heliocentric model.  
The change each new technology brings with, that we can see in our older generations even now, many old people regard stuff they didnt grew up with like it was evil.  
Even  in policies. People still alive not only find gay marriage wrong, but some even regard interracial ones the same. Not many, but they exist.

(Mind you, I am not attacking you, this is just a musing, no ill intent)"
719,28,"Yes. Yikes. Let us hope this is not the intention of our fellow humans. However, you know some celebrity is signing a contract right now to produce and sell their ""star meat""…  "
720,28,"Not really.

Although I wouldn't eat it I don't have an issue with someone wanting to try soylent green burgers. It's weird but nobody is being hurt and the 'meat' was never part of a person so it isn't cannibalism."
721,28,this would be well avoided.
722,28,I would eat it. I don't have a problem eating lab grown human-meat because it was never a human.

725,28,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but... didn't the mad cow disease appear because we started feeding processed cow meat to cows? Something about prions being formed or something."
726,28,"In the UK it was dead sheep being fed to cows which started it.

First it was only legal to create cow feed from healthy sheep. Then with lobbying from the agriculture industry, it became legal to use ""fallen"" sheep.  Those included sheep with Scrapie, a prion caused transmissible spongiform encephalopathies.

Then with more lobbying the temperature, at which the sheep had to be processed before turning into cow feed, was dropped. To save on energy costs. The temperature was high enough to kill all bacteria and viruses but not a very low energy state protein like prions. Heat denatures proteins, makes them fold tighter. Prions are already mis-folded and in a very low energy state. 

And then it made the jump from cooked cows to people.

For a long time people refused to believe that could happen. Only after several usually young people died from  spongiform encephalopathies, did the government start to take things seriously. Prior to that, with help from the industry, they had been actively denying everything, and defending the processing of sheep into cattle feed. 

"
727,29,I'm looking forward to the day that I don't feel bad ordering a burger.
728,31,"This is interesting. From my understanding vegans are those who do not eat or use animal products. So is lab grown meat considered vegan because despite originally coming from an animal, it's vegan because no animals were killed or harmed in its creation? In the future if everyone exclusively uses lab grown animal products, will we all be considered vegan? Or will there even be a need to make a distinction at that point?"
729,31,"The article doesn't even mention the climate benefits. Clean meat uses about 95% less land, energy, and water than animal agriculture. If we can get it cheaper than animal meat, we could take vast areas of farmland currently used to grow grain for animals, and let it return to natural forest and prairie, absorbing vast amounts of carbon and improving biodiversity."
730,31,"Vegans aren’t clones. I’m not one, but I assume each will make their own decision based on their motivations in choosing to be vegan in the first place..."
731,31,"I'm interested in lab-grown meat purely because of the possibilities for new meat products.  Imagine eating a crab steak, or a lobster tail the size of your arm.    "
732,31,I’m very interested in this and have been following it for a while. I ultimately think it’s positive. One issue with meat from animals is how much water it takes to produce it. I’m curious how much water it takes to produce 1 lb of lab grown meat. I’m also curious what Margaret Atwood thinks of this. 
733,31,Isn’t lab grown meat derived from an animal? Whatever they took from the animal to be able to grow the meat should mean it’s not vegan because the animal couldn’t give it’s consent. 
734,31,"Didn't Leonardo dicaprio just donate $100 mill to help fight climate change. Maybe this was it. 
Or maybe the article explains."
735,31,"I dont get why people wants to replicate meat, instead of working towards something new entirely. "
736,31,Does the lab meat industry sponsor this sub? There’s at least one post a week promoting this nonsense. 
737,31,I'll never understand. Spending $100 million dollars on this just because people don't want to stop eating meat. It boggles my mind 
738,31,How about they not do this because meat from farms are amazing in fact lets add more animals to the mix lets get deer and elk in there
739,31,Add this to the long list of things vegans can't eat just don't tell them the veggies they eat maybe one of the smartest living things on the planet. 
740,31,"Just eat a steak and stop whining. Use that money to raise cattle and feed the hungry.  I don't get it , you're going to leave the earth, the cow you don't want to eat is going to keel over and rot, the chicken you don't want to eat is going to croak and rot in a field, you're not saving shit by not eating a steak.  You're just denying yourself a pleasurable and nutritious meal."
741,31,So I have this question.. lab grown meat comes from somewhere right? Well everything is living and breathing so technically they are all animals well if something comes from a plant to grow lab grown meat wouldn’t that mean it’s a still a  1 in whatever chemicals to make by product?
742,31,"I'm an ethical & environmental vegan and I'm totally down for clean meat! No suffering, no problem. I can't speak for health vegans cause that's not really my thing."
743,31,"I'm not vegan so I may be mistaken, but I'm under the impression in-vitro/lab-grown/cultured meat is considered vegan since it's grown without a brain and nervous system. Apparently some vegans eat bivalves (oysters, clams, etc.) because they lack brains and only have rudimentary nervous systems, but there is some dispute about whether or not that really qualifies as vegan in their community.

Personally I'm interested in in-vitro/lab-grown/cultured meat as a solution to over-fishing and over-hunting problems, and as an opportunity to provide a lot more food varieties than farming techniques could ever achieve. That it would reduce the amount of suffering we inflict on other species is just an added bonus to me, although I am in favour of preserving biodiversity as a resource for medical, genetic engineering and similar technologies and in-vitro/lab-grown/cultured meat does help with that."
744,31,"I’m pretty sure a lot of vegans and vegetarians would eat this type of meat regardless of what the meat is considered just to create a market for it. 


I’m not a vegan of vegetarian but I’m going to buy it just to help it out. 

"
745,31,I think most practical vegans focus on the overall goal of minimizing animal suffering while still able to make sustainable healthy food.  Lab grown meat ticks the ethical box (assuming there’s not some kind of tissue farm situation) and I’m hoping that this kind of financial investment allow it to be produced efficiently and at scale.  
746,31,"Veganism is a philosophy that seeks to minimize exploitation of animals.  If only “vegan” food was available, people wouldn’t be automatically vegan because being vegan means also avoiding all other forms of animal exploitation and abuse, such as zoos for example."
747,31,"Vegans do not eat any meat or dairy products under any circumstances. So no, with the current definition they would not be considered vegan/vegetarian.

However, I imagine this line will be blurred in the future. There will be a difference between meat eaters, vegans, and those who only eat lab grown products. There are also many different motivations to why someone chooses to be vegetarian/vegan, from health and environmental issues to ethical concerns.

There is definitely a market for this, and I imagine many of those who do not eat meat currently would be happy to eat lab grown products. Speaking for myself, I have not consumed any meat in about 10 years and do not plan to. Yet, I would definitely try a lab grown product (if it is ethical and environmentally sustainable), but would not eat it regularly due to health concerns."
748,31,Did you say...crab...*steak?* ...oh sweet baby Jesus...
749,31,"The book *Clean Meat* has numbers on land, energy, and water usage. I forget what the number was for water but on every resource lab-grown meat used at least 90% less, and at least one resource was more like 98% less."
750,31,"> Whatever they took from the animal to be able to grow the meat should mean it’s not vegan because the animal couldn’t give it’s consent.

Recent advances in the technology allow in-vitro/lab-grown/cultured meat to be grown using a DNA profile, rather than using an animal-derived source as a ""starter""."
751,31,"Firstly, it's a far more ethical way to deliver the benefits of meat eating.

Speciesm is something humanity has struggled with for a long time, this is one step closer to eradicating the need for any animal to suffer. 

With artificially grown meat being mass produced we would also need significantly less room for farmland, which in turn would increase the areas of which trees could be planted and possibly revert rain forest damage done via farming. 

Though certain ethical arguments may arise about what it means for a species to flourish, personally I'm of the opinion that the quality of an animals life out weighs the quantity though the two are not mutually exclusive and should never be treated as such. 

There are many different kinds of meat (obviously), some of which are significantly more healthy than others. 

It might also be possible to combat the rampant obesity seen in the later years of society by controlling what kind of meat is readily available. 


There are almost no cons to the mass production of artificial meat (save a reduction in jobs for farmers, especially battery farmers). Though those jobs could be considered unethical anyways. "
752,31,"It’s not nonsense, it’s the future and a possible lifesaving solution for the growing population of human beings. "
753,31,"Do people legit think this is for vegans it is to stop the enormous amount of methane produced from farming animals, i guess the headline is just too good, no need to read further."
754,31,"That's like wondering why people don't want to go back to living in caves to prevent climate change. 

Most people enjoy eating meat and won't give it up, so if we can make an alternative that looks, tastes and basically is meat then we can keep (almost) everyone happy. "
755,31,In-vitro/lab-grown/cultured meat operations could potentially offer *a lot* more variety than any farm ever could.
756,31,What? And not get the chance to eat some Justin Bieber lab grown (from his cells) meat? Please.... things are gonna get way more interesting.
757,31,"Sure, meat from farms and live animals is great, but it's completely unsustainable, both economically and environmentally."
758,31,"Even if what you just said wasn't reductionist nonsense, there's still many good reasons to cut out animal products for more reasons than animal suffering (which is a very good reason). Pollution, health, and human welfare are huge ones. I would gladly eat clean meat, and I know a lot of vegans and vegetarians who would.. And even if they didn't want to, what's it to you? 

Plants feel that they want you to eat their fruits and vegetables and nuts and grains.  For them, the eating of their parts is not murder.

Why?

The parts we eat which is not the plant itself, but the produce of the plant, help them to propagate, to survive, by spreading their seed, an act that they themselves cannot do as well on their own.  So yes, plants do have feelings within the context of a plant.  And that feeling is ‘please eat my fruits and vegetables but not my trunk or branches’ and this is exactly what we as humans do.

Wheat and grains are a bit different in that we harvest the whole plant but keep in mind, the life of wheat is one season.  It would not live to the next season.  The harvest of wheat causes its seed to fall back to the ground.  And so again this harvest ensures the survival of wheat.

No tree, bush or vine has ever died from the picking and eating of its produce.

Animal consumption doesn't equal plant consumption, period. Stop propogating lies. The reason vegans protest the meat industry is because it's gross, outdated, killing the planet and ourselves, and employs an underpaid and exploited workforce.

Vegans understand they can't live without consuming life, they're not idiots. They just want to reduce the overall suffering. Humans suffer more than animals, animals more than plants, and that is that. 
"
759,31,"Just wanted you to know that non-vegans think you are an idiot too. Your comments aimed at ""trolling"" (if you could even call your piss poor attempts at semi-coherent sentences that) vegans give far more insight into your own lack of education (within the subject matter, I'm sure you are well versed in something, probably) than anything else you tried to achieve. "
760,31,"Mate, I think there is a whole different reason for the technology... like methane reduction... farmed animals create like 10% of greenhouse gases (could be wildly off)"
761,31,"Nobody is whining, but most people will only ever be able to afford eating Bluefin Tuna, Seladang, Lion, or some other exotic (or custom) meat is if it's made available to the masses through in-vitro/lab-grown/cultured meat production. There's nothing wrong with being enthusiastic about that, especially since it's exactly the sort of thing this sub is for."
762,31,"So, since everything dies eventually, it doesn't matter how much suffering I cause? 

Surely this applies to people as well. It doesn't matter how much I enjoy my life at your expense then, since you were going to die no matter what. 
"
763,31,"You're wrong with this. If the entire world ate as much red meat as the US there wouldn't be the land for all the cattle, and the greenhouse gas impact would be immense. 

Over time, supply adapts to meet demand, so there wouldn't be the same volume being produced.

I love a steak as much as the next guy, but your comments here ignore the big picture.
"
764,31,"I suppose but you don't have to kill the animal to get a muscle tissue sample. After that, clone the clones."
765,31,"So your question isn't particularly coherent so I'll try to brake it down into what I think you mean then answer that. 

Your premise: There exists no difference between lab grown meat and animals, lab grown meat should be considered an animal.

First reason you are incorrect: An animal is the summation of multiple working parts, but most importantly the brain. A three legged cat would still be called a cat, though a cat's leg in separation would not. 

Similarly, this separation would be treated in the same way. 

Secondly: Drawing from the first point, you can have animals that have severe brain damage would still be called animals (even though it's not particularly applicable here as the meat has no brain altogether but it may help you see why your stand point is naive). 

This is normally due to their ability to suffer, something lab grown meat lacks.


There is no way a reasonable and rational adult human could believe that lab grown meat could be considered an animal. 

At best it could be considered *part* of an animal, but that is still a long shot and can be disputed."
766,31,"Yeah, but in reality are you even going to like the taste? It's like non-alcoholic beer at this point. I've had periods of vegetarianism and there was always a point that I wasnt hungry for meat."
767,31,"Not one but house mate is. 

Most health based vegans are also a little efficial vegans. 

They will likely avoid red meat and other products like milk and eggs. But be happier with the healthier chicken meats if the ethics are clean. And lets face it chicken meat is pretty shitty ethics wise. "
768,31,"Hey, vegan here, I feel like I'm safe in saying that most ethical vegans would eat this, since we just have a problem with animals suffering and dieing so we can eat. Something like a Double McTestTube should be fine with most.   


Idk about those crazy people who just eat like 50 bananas a day because they think it will make them into some sort of ubermensch but I'd  doubt it. "
769,31,"Oh man I never thought about the variety angle. Theoretically it seems if you can grow one animal you could grow most animal's meat. There could potentially be exotic meats or current ""luxury"" meats would be more economical. You could get duck, venison, gator, ostrich...whatever really if the technique becomes ubiquitous. "
770,31,"IMO the biggest implication is the reduction of methane released into the atmosphere by fully grown cows. 

Mass husbandry is more impactful on climate change than all cars in the world combined, but nobody ever talks about that. As long as our buffalo wings, chicken wings, steak, and other meat products stay cheap, we‘re happy.

Methane is about four times as potent as a greenhouse gas than CO2, but after 10 years it oxidises into CO2. 

FUCK CHEAP MEAT, WE DO NOT NEED MEAT EVERY DAY!!! FUCK MCDONALDS AND EVERY OTHER FAST FOOD RESTAURANT!!!"
771,31,Over hunting isn’t a problem. Hardly anyone worldwide get their meat through hunting 
772,31,"Slightly unrelated, but coming from Michigan I’ve never even heard of over hunting. Here, I’m surprised our hunting seasons aren’t extended with how many deer and shit we have.

On-topic, I’m hoping lab grown meat can be like hydroponics eventually: producing the same amount of (or more) food in a much smaller space. I think they’ll share a lot of the same cost issues relating to new technology, unfortunately."
773,31,"Vegans should support lab grown meat. Every lab grown burger is one less dead cow burger, no?"
774,31,Wrong. Most vegans will likely eat cruelty free meat once it hits the market.
775,31,"It's based on current norms. But some vegans argue that things like Road kill or other situations where a the animal has died unrelated to the consumption of its meat makes it okay to consume.

But back to lab grown meat, you can't base the argument around actual animal products because the vegan argument is about and against living creatures being consumed or exploited for food products other materials (like leather.) "

780,31,"I would say ostrich might be a good alternative for farms but I looked it up and all the studies on it are very split with some finding they produce the same levels of methane as cows and others finding ostrich farms produce minimal methane. I hate science, it claims it knows facts but seems to not know what those facts are. Chicken and pig though are minimal methane confirmed. Turkey as well. Snake and alligator are also good alternatives, I’ve has rattlesnake before very very good 10/10 would eat again. Alligator though would be tricky as if the meats not fresh it becomes very rubbery. "
781,31,Living in a cave is nothing like not eating meat. Most of us would probably die or suffer greatly. Not eating meat is as simple and easy as it gets. And you don't have to spend 100 million dollars in the process

Over-hunting (for food specifically) is still a problem for a handful of species, such as pangolin, bonobos, and elephants (the trunks of tuskless elephants are considered a delicacy)."
793,31,"I clearly said that most vegans would not have a problem with eating it. As someone who has not ate meat products for 10 years, the point of my post is that the current definition of being vegan is NOT consuming ANY meat products - it does not consider where the meat is sourced or motivations behind it. BUT...

With the introduction of lab grown meat this line is going to be blurred and definitions will probably have to change. There will be a difference between people who only eat lab grown meat products and those who still decide not to. I imagine the majority of vegans will support and eat lab grown meat."
794,31,"There are not only ethical motivations towards such a diet though. I'm not disputing that the majority of vegans would be OK with it. But, it is much more complicated than that and is reflected in the already huge varieties of non carnivorous diets out there. It is ultimately a great thing and will hopefully circumvent environmental concerns too. But it has to be considered that many people do not eat meat due to health reasons - would they still if it was lab grown? "

3. There's obviously a market for in-vitro/lab-grown/cultured meat products, and since that market isn't harming anyone there isn't any reason to oppose it.

4. There are already numerous organizations, with *a lot* more backing than any of the in-vitro/lab-grown/cultured meat producers, working toward organ replacement technologies.

This an article about growing synthetic meat so animals don't have to be killed for it, to basically try and fix all of those problems you listed. 

People aren't going to just give up meat en-masse, it won't happen no matter what you say, you can try and take the moral high ground as much as you like regarding energy consumption for a meal, but I'll bet there's plenty of stuff you do that isn't planned around the environment, you've just chosen meat because its something that you personally are happy to give up. 

&#x200B;

If we accept that people won't give up meat, then if we can create it in a way that doesn't involve hurting animals, doesn't take up large amounts of land and water and produce large amounts of methane & CO2 then you should be happy.  This is literally aimed at solving the problems you listed. 

&#x200B;

As a bonus we get meat that isn't pumped full of hormones & other crap. Its perfectly possible to eat meat and live a healthy life. Although I think most western people could stand to cut it down considerably.

829,33,"**Platelet lysates**

[Platelets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet) are components of the blood that assist in clotting, wound healing, and general immune function. Platelets harbor a variety of different chemokines, growth factors, and adhesion proteins that can be released via lysis. Because of their abundance in the blood (in humans; 1.5 - 4.5 x 105/µL) and attainability through standard protocols for concentrating platelets following [apheresis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apheresis), human platelet lysates have been used for *in vitro* cell propagation since the 1980s. Platelet lysates contain a rich protein-heavy mixture of growth factors, proteins such as albumin (20-36 mg/mL), albumin’s typical cargo of vitamins, minerals, and lipids, immunoglobulins, as well as glucose and cholesterol. Therefore, platelet lysates are highly similar to FBS but have higher immunoglobulin content and may contain coagulation factors such as fibrinogen when produced without activation using thrombin.[41](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26561934) 

Platelet lysates are obtained by concentration of platelets using various methods, followed by lysis via repeated freeze-thaw cycles, activation with thrombin or calcium chloride, bursting via sonication, or solvent and detergent treatments. It is currently unclear how upstream methods of lysate preparation relate to optimized downstream performance, but even so, many studies using primarily human mesenchymal stem cells report improved performance of platelet lysates vs. FBS across multiple criteria.[42](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26561934) For instance, substituting FBS with platelet lysates has been shown to significantly reduce population doubling times[43](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3340550/) and increase total outgrowth over multiple doublings[44](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17655588) in human mesenchymal stem cells. These effects have been replicated in other stem cell types, including skeletal myoblasts,[45](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5932844/) and platelet lysates support general cell growth in a similar manner to FBS in many other stem cell types.[46](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26561934) It is perhaps not surprising that human cells perform well in human-derived platelet lysates and this improved performance may make platelet lysates potentially attractive for cultivated meat applications.  

Platelet lysates offer potential advantages over FBS but several questions remain, including how human platelet lysates perform in non-human cells (obtaining platelet lysates from a specific animal species is likely to be economically nonviable for reasons described below and misaligned with animal welfare). Other areas of active research include understanding the role of high immunoglobulin A, G, and M content in platelet lysate, the optimal method of preparation, the role of donor blood type and age, and production, supply, and quality issues. Even if these were decidedly non-issues, the limited supply likely hampers its use in cultivated meat. Commercial distributors of human platelet lysate have been established in the USA and Europe. However, the current prices of [human platelet lysate](https://www.stemcell.com/human-platelet-lysate.html) exceed $1000 per half-liter, making it more expensive than FBS. In theory, production capacity could scale and lower prices. For instance, it is estimated that 5-20% of platelet concentrates from whole blood donations expire during their 5-7 day storage limit and these could instead be frozen and used in cell culture applications, potentially opening up a 100,000 - 250,000L concentrated platelet byproduct industry globally, equal to roughly 25% of the global annual production of FBS.[47](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26561934) As this only takes into account wasted byproduct, this number could increase with demand fairly easily by more focused efforts on capturing platelet concentrates during blood donation and collection. 

Another production method of platelet lysate is via iPSC-derived megakaryocytes, the immune cell that creates large numbers of platelets. Recent advances in differentiation to the megakaryocyte lineage makes it possible to create platelets *in vitro* that contain increased growth factor content compared to their *in vivo* counterparts.[48](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6111809/#jcmm13698-bib-0008),[49](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmed.2018.00239/full) Despite this, it is hard to envision growing human cells to create a product to then be sold at an affordable price for the cultivated meat industry. Additionally, the high demand for platelets in human patients suggests any iPSC-derived platelet lysate product would first be sold at higher price points for clinical use, likely outbidding any reason for distributors to service the cultivated meat industry at lower prices.

Taken together, the upstream processing and quality control needed for safety, especially when pooling hundreds of donor samples in the case of blood-drawn platelets, likely make human platelet lysate economically nonviable for cultivated meat at scale. Nevertheless, increased understanding of the unique composition of platelet lysates and growth factors contained therein can be leveraged for the creation of newer formulations produced using more economical methods (discussed later)."

833,33,yeah I realize this. It's mostly to capture some people that may be interested in taking a deeper dive as it's a popular topic on this forum. We are working on producing short 3-5 minute video content (we already offer a [free course](https://www.gfi.org/OnlineCourses)) but this is geared for a fairly advanced scientific audience. People seem to stumble upon these when they are researching the topic so having it live somewhere on the internet is still valuable.
834,33,"**Conditioned media**

Conditioned media is a term for the spent cell culture media following a period of cellular growth. It therefore includes all of the secreted factors that have accumulated in the medium over time, including growth factors, metabolites, cytokines, extracellular vesicles, and extracellular matrix proteins. The harvesting of conditioned media has been used for growing a variety of different stem cell types and even as a potential cell-free therapeutic.[50](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2014/965849/) The conditioned media from a specific cell type could be used to grow the same cell type or be used to grow an entirely different cell type altogether.

Conditioned media can also be used to triangulate growth factors required for cell growth. For instance, during the development of human embryonic stem cell cultures, the use of mouse embryonic fibroblasts as “feeder” cells was found to be sufficient to support the maintenance of pluripotency over time, and removal of fibroblast cells led to differentiation.[51](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/282/5391/1145.long) Studying the specific growth factors and cytokines secreted from these mouse embryonic fibroblasts led to the eventual development of the cell culture media formulations for pluripotent stem cells.[52](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4351689/) Today, [mouse embryonic fibroblast-conditioned media](https://www.emdmillipore.com/US/en/product/EmbryoMax-MEF-Conditioned-Media,MM_NF-SCM103) is still sold as one option for pluripotent stem cell culture. 

However, this methodology is not necessarily straightforward. The [secretome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretome) of a single cell type such as myoblasts can contain hundreds of proteins, which may act independently or in concert to exert their effects.[53](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2984231/) Additionally, some secreted factors may be inhibitory to desired processes such as cell growth and differentiation, and these may need to be removed entirely or kept at sufficiently low levels to prevent their effects.[54](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22305571) Significant work will be needed to understand the secretome from many of the understudied species and cell types used in cultivated meat production.

Nevertheless, similar strategies using conditioned media to grow cells for cultivated meat have been conceived of. For example, the Japanese startup Integriculture has [filed a patent](https://www.robertyaman.com/blog/clean-meat-patent-analysis-part-4) for a system called CulNet, which describes a series of interconnected feeder cells that produce conditioned media to feed a different group of cells.[55](https://patents.google.com/patent/JP6111510B1/en) A similar conditioned medium system has been filed by the cultivated meat company Fork and Goode.[56](http://www.freepatentsonline.com/20190376026.pdf) Such strategies may be sufficient to supplement cell growth and assist in the discovery of growth factor requirements for new cell lines, however, the affordability of growing multiple cell types as a means of supplementing cell growth versus simply producing the important growth factors through more cost-effective methods (discussed later) may be difficult to reconcile. 

**Single protein solutions - Sericin** 

The use of a single protein that could stimulate cell growth and proliferation in a similar manner to FBS would be advantageous from a cost and usability perspective. Sericin is one of two major protein constituents of silk produced by the silkworm *Bombyx mori*. It is considered a byproduct of the silk textile industry, however, its unique amino acid composition, hydrophilicity, and biocompatibility yields potential use cases in the biological sciences and biomedicine.[57](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21558082) In cell culture, the addition of sericin has assisted in the proliferation of various mammalian cell lines,[58](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19003099),[59](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep31516) attachment of mammalian cells,[60](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15725668) and spreading,[61](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22860103) all of which are important qualities of FBS supplementation. These results have extended to other cell types such as myoblasts[62](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20635352) and species such as insect cells.[63](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10529-005-7177-5) Few studies examine in detail the mechanism of sericin’s proliferative qualities and further studies are needed to make these determinations. Nevertheless, the success of a single protein such as sericin holds promise for the discovery of other proteins with similar biological properties that could be used for FBS replacement in cultivated meat applications.

**Knockout Serum Replacement** 

Translational human embryonic stem cell research has dealt with many of the same issues (discussed in Series IVa) related to FBS inclusion as the cultivated meat industry is currently tackling. [Knockout serum replacement](https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/life-science/stem-cell-research/stem-cell-culture/knockout-media-stem-cell-culture/knockout-serum-replacement.html) is one example of an attempt to replace FBS in a medium for a single cell type such as embryonic stem cells. Its composition is chemically undefined (discussed later) due to variable lipid content, but is relatively consistent from batch to batch. Its ingredient list includes 12 amino acids (both essential and non-essential), antioxidants (vitamin B1, reduced glutathione, vitamin C), 19 trace elements, and transferrin, insulin, and lipid-rich albumin.[64](https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO1998030679) When used with an appropriate basal medium formulation and added growth factors, knockout serum replacement can stimulate embryonic stem cell self-renewal and maintain pluripotency over time in a similar and often improved manner over FBS. Therefore, the inclusion of a specific set of ingredients found in FBS, many of which have been previously discussed, offers a sufficient strategy for FBS replacement and lays the groundwork for a discussion of the majority of work that has been done to replace FBS through the formulation of chemically defined media."

It boost estrogen production while inhibiting testosterone production.  Fermentation actually destroys most of its problems and can be quite healthy.  Natto for instance is a great source of k2( absolutely awful though I've been told).  I could go further but google Weston Price foundation.  They have some good info.  

Since I've gone this far I would like to add a few non food quality issues. It's incredibly intensive to grow.

848,36,"Wow. Thank you for the very in-depth posting!

The two big ""veggie burger"" companies seem to get the most love in this group, but I'm much more interested in the lab-grown meat industry. I eat maybe 2-8 burgers in an average year, but consume anywhere between 60 and 100 (depending on weather) steaks/year--and I don't see the veggie burger companies being able to make a plant-based steak any time soon.

Once lab-grown meat is able to achieve these milestones, I think they will be unstoppable:

1. production: right now it seems like it takes forever even to make a small amount of lab-grown meat

2. taste/texture: from what I've read, they are well on their way to achieving this; for simple things like burgers it is fairly easy--but getting the marbling correct for a porterhouse is still a bit of a ways off

3. price: this is the big hurdle. If a lab-grown steak costs twice as much as a steak from a slaughtered cow, you'll be able to sell to people well off enough to let their humanitarian side override their economic side, but people on a tight budget will still make their purchasing decisions with their wallet. Get the price comparable (or even cheaper, since there won't be the cost of land, feed, water, etc) and the lab-grown meat industry will have a figurative licence to print money!"
849,36,"I'm very interested in the labor and production impacts as cell-based meat scales up. I'm following the series closely, but perhaps you could indicate where it might be most appropriate to ask the following questions?

* In the future, once the scientific process of creating and scaling up cell-based meat production is largely settled, how much automation will be involved in actual production of the meat?
* Are you aware of any groups/initiatives working or planning to retrain traditional meat-industry workers (i.e., meat processing plant workers) to move into cell-based production or other related industries as cell-based starts to replace traditional?

I realize that these questions are less related to the science and more to the economics, but I thought I'd ask.

I have read some news says some companies have achieved success on those already.

I am looking forward to seeing more information about other kinds of man-made food!"
853,36,"Hi e\_swartz, how are you involved in the Clean Meat space?"
854,36,"It's true that the cost right now is high as companies figure out how to scale their production and reduce costs from large drivers like the medium that the cells grow in. But people wouldn't be doing this if it didn't have the potential to be profitable. The global meat market is around $1 trillion. It's likely that the technologies used in cell therapy and organ/tissue engineering will crossover to the cell-based meat space, and vice versa. However,  there is a large difference (cost, safety, regulation) in making tissues that are alive and intended to survive in a human body versus those that can be dead and eaten. So while it is a challenge to produce the quantity of cells for cell-based meat, we don't have to worry about a functional tissue surviving in a human. We also encourage governments to look at the externalities of conventional animal agriculture -- the influence of antibiotic resistance, environmental impacts, etc -- when you take these costs into account, making meat from animal stem cells doesn't seem so expensive.  

Plant-based meats, like the ones featured at the top of Futurology right now, definitely have a lot of potential in removing animals from the system. But the data shows that meat consumption is still at all time highs (per capita) in the USA and the rest of the world, and consumption is expected to grow as developing countries increase their GDP. The truth is that people like meat and not everyone will switch to plant-based options, even if they compete on taste, price, and convenience. Your point on the links of meat consumption to negative health consequences (e.g. colon cancer) are well-taken. Cell-based meat has the advantage of tunable nutritional profiles -- the ability to reduce the amount of cholesterol and saturated fats, through genetic engineering (if allowed), or creating blends of different meats and fats with healthier profiles (e.g. salmon). Nevertheless, there are things about cooking and eating animal tissues that may be harmful and can't be removed from the process."
855,36,"There are likely close to 40 companies now being formed across the globe. Many are in stealth mode or have not yet raised money, which is why you haven't heard of them yet. The field is still very nascent! In general, companies in this space are working on all the areas that will eventually be covered in these series. First, the establishment of cell lines are key, especially when dealing with new species. From there, figuring out how to scale the production from growing cells in a few milliliters to liters and hundreds of liters of volume is the next challenge. Simultaneously, many are working on creation of serum-free medium formulations that are cost-effective. Eventually, companies will focus on bioengineering strategies to replicate complex meat structures like a steak (although some have already started on this). There are also traditional life science companies that make cell culture medium or bioreactors, for instance, that have begun to help address these problems. 

There are a lot of different approaches to the above challenges which makes it interesting.  "
856,36,"Regarding steak, we'll see. Impossible Foods announced that they [were going after steak](https://www.eater.com/2019/1/11/18177441/impossible-foods-fake-meat-substitute-steak) next. On the cell-based side, it's definitely going to be a challenge. One Israeli company has [created steak strips](https://www.businessinsider.com/aleph-farms-israeli-startup-makes-first-lab-grown-clean-steak-meat-photos-video-2018-12) but there's a lot of work to do to make those tissues larger. The good thing is that there is likely a roadmap to do so, which I discuss at length in the third series. The other positive is that this is really the first time that money is being dedicated solely on replicating meat, so it's perhaps not a surprise that it seems like a far cry now -- we've just begun.  I hope you get to try some cell-based steaks soon ;) "
857,36,"You're welcome to ask me anything you'd like now. 
(1) Automation is definitely going to be important (I talk about this in the next series). Companies that aren't thinking about or implementing automation now may find themselves struggling in the future. Automation can assist in limiting batch-to-batch variability, reducing manual labor costs, reagent costs, and lab space in general. It can also make regulatory compliance a lot easier. But there's going to be some innovation needed in this area. There are systems in cell therapy that permit closed loop production of a stem-cell derived product, but they are small in size. We need to figure out how to scale that up and customize it for the cell-based meat industry. Identification of critical process parameters across the industry that can be targeted for automation or open-source software development will also help. 

(2) Not yet to my knowledge, but I think it's a good idea. As you may know, large meat companies like Tyson and Cargill have invested in companies in this space. We don't want the meat industry to be our enemy, and there is definitely a role for meat scientists to play in product development.  In terms of plant workers, the best parallel I can point to is in the dairy industry, [where there are instances of people switching to making plant-based milks](https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2018/01/30/580393275/a-century-old-dairy-ditches-cows-for-high-tech-plant-milk). The challenge in this industry, similarly to other places where technology replaces manual labor, is the manual laborers often do not have the technical qualifications for the new job. It's something that will be difficult to address, for sure."
858,36,"We definitely don't want marketing to be associated with teratomas haha. But companies opting to utilize induced pluripotent stem cells as starting material fundamentally are working with cells that can create any tissue of the adult body, including bone and vascular tissues (and create teratomas *in vivo*). 

In general, most companies are focused on creating muscle or fat, and maybe some connective tissues. I don't know of any that are creating bone, although bone is part of some meals, as mentioned in your article. From a cost perspective, the idea of creating bone just for kicks is a bit silly, although you can create bone tissues from stem cells. As far as vascular tissues, this is a large limitation for organ engineering right now. In essence, cells need mass transfer of oxygen and other nutrients, and this is best achieved if a cell is within 200 microns of a blood vessel. For cell-based meat, however, we likely can rely on the perfusion of cell culture medium through porous scaffolds that replicate vasculature, rather than creating blood vessels themselves. Here, cells grow on 3D networks of biomaterials that permit the diffusion of key nutrients as they mature. I discuss this at length in Series III. "
859,36,"Yes, we also support companies in the plant-based meat space. There a bunch that are utilizing plant (or algae, bacteria, etc) proteins to recapitulate meat!"
860,36,"I am a research advisor with The Good Food Institute (GFI) which is a nonprofit that serves as a hub in this space. I grew a lot of skeletal muscle tissue from human stem cells during my PhD which is how I became interested in this space. My role is to help educate the public and attract scientific talent to enter this field. We also aim to analyze the industry and identify technical hurdles that are most pressing, as well as mobilize funding for basic research to address those challenges.  GFI as a whole works across the board -- on policy, entrepreneurship, and engaging with corporations in the food and life science spaces."
861,36,appreciate this reply.  cell based replacements for expensive fish is probably the $ zone to focus your efforts on.
862,36,"I think you've answered my known questions on automation, and I'm sure I'll have all my unknown questions answered in the next series as well. (Very interested to hear about the closed-loop stem cell production methods!)

Your parallel about labor retraining and the dairy industry is a good point. Many of the stories about the human impact of moving away from traditional animal agriculture seem to come from the dairy industry. I realize that this question encompasses a lot of different factors (automation impact on labor in general, obsolete industries and labor, retraining program efficacy), but I appreciate your thoughts on what you currently see. It seems like there is a need for more focus on the human impact of moving away from traditional animal agriculture, there will be plenty of work to do on these questions.

Thanks for the replies and for offering this series!"
863,36,"Thanks for this answer

Yes, indeed marketing! so I do like the first paragraph of your answer I will try to learn more. Many foods are enhanced by bone but maybe it's the collagen that's important so it's that what we want to culture.

I have blogged about vegetable-based scaffolds for the cells that make up shark fins(for soup)"
864,36,"Perhaps **CRISPR** could slice favorable treats from Teratomas genetics that might express themselves in a bioreactor or on scaffolding?

Not sure if the desired teats would express themselves in a bioreactor and it might not be bone that we are looking for but perhaps vascularization and connective tissues "
865,36,"Yes, there are companies working on growing collagen via cellular agriculture methods for enhancement of food and cosmetic products sold in Asian markets. Things like bone marrow inside of a bone would be fairly challenging I would imagine although I am less well versed in that area. What type of plant-based scaffolds have you explored?"

868,37,Thank you! This is a really awesome write up. Can you go into some detail about how CRISPR technologies could be used for cell-based meat technology?
869,37,"What would be your advice for somebody who has majored in a not-so-related field in biochemistry (nucleic acid chemistry in my case, for example) who wants to get involved in the development of cell-based meat?

871,37,"Hey Elliot, thanks a lot. Your posts provide great insights, and I'm curious about what would look like a large scale cultured meat production system. 

The thing is that I've some troubles deriving the annual cultured meat output from a total bioreactor capacity. 

In one [medium post](https://medium.com/@josiah.zayner/cultured-meat-will-not-be-realistic-anytime-soon-the-numbers-behind-the-hype-77b64d580996), I've found this :  *""Now,  this warehouse has a max output of 28,000L, let’s imagine they run it  flawlessly at our overinflated production numbers from above of 10g / L  of cells and a new culture every 10 days. From that you could make only  around 23,000 lbs of meat a year.""* 

==> Is that true ? Let's imagine a  factory has a 400,000L capacity (if I get it, it's possible with the right number of perfusion stirred tanks bioreactors of a 2000L capacity). Could this factory produce  only around 400,000 pounds of cultured meat annually ? 

More generally, how do you derive the annual cultured meat output from the total bioreactor capacity ? What assumptions would you make (10-day production process ? What about losses during the process ?)

I'd like to do (on my free time, besides starting a cultured meat promoting NGO) a design study for a large scale cultured meat facility (about the same size that the current biggest bio-pharmaceutical plant), but this limits me."

873,37,"The cell culture medium will be the focus of the 4th series. In general, a cell culture medium contains all of the necessary components for cell survival and growth -- amino acids, vitamins, salts, water, and a carbon source. Growth factors, or biologically active proteins, that can signal a cell to proliferate, for instance, are often included as well. Especially for stem cell types that are used in this process. 

The challenge comes from finding medium formulations that are suitable for the different species and cell types used in the process, as well as finding and optimizing substitutes for animal serum which is often used as a supplement because it contains many beneficial components for cell growth. Additionally, costs need to be brought down in order for scaling of the process to occur, and this will require using more affordable bulk supplies of medium components and additional supply-chain side manufacturing. 

This will be covered in depth in the 4th series (released in June)"
874,37,"Yes, the fourth series will talk a bit on the regulatory status of the technology and I will discuss gene editing and how it could be used in the bioprocess. Additionally, the fifth series on products will explore a bit on how gene editing could be used to improve a final product (for instance, by altering downstream nutrition). 

There are a lot of possibilities here so unfortunately it would be hard to give a really quick summary."
875,37,"I'd recommend continuing to educate yourself around the relevant scientific areas that will play a role in developing this tech. A general biochemistry background still gives you a solid foundation to work from. The field is still nascent and there's still time to learn new skills, become more adept in a new field, or get some more relevant hands-on research experience. A non-obvious application for biochemistry is food science, which is needed for cell-based meat products but also other plant-based products as well.

**Droplet-based Bioprinting**

In droplet-based bioprinting, picoliter droplets (10-50µm diameter) are deposited on top of a substrate without direct contact being made between the nozzle and the substrate. Inkjet printing is the most common form of droplet-based bioprinting and can be further divided into whether droplets are created via electric, acoustic, or heat sources.[^(20)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0734975016301719) Of these, [piezoelectric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piezoelectricity) and thermal methods are frequently used, where an electric charge or sharp increase in heat, produces pressure increases at the nozzle, forming droplets. Droplet-based methods have the advantage of precise control of cell numbers distributed in each droplet and high resolution printing (10-50 µm), however, the applications for droplet-based printing of complex structures is diminished due to a low range of bioink viscosities (3.5 - 12 mPa•s) and requirements of low surface tension and rare [rheopectic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheopecty) traits.[^(21)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0734975016301719) For these reasons, it’s unlikely that droplet-based bioprinting would be utilized for cell-based meat.  

**Laser-Assisted Bioprinting**

Laser-assisted bioprinting, also commonly referred to as laser-induced forward transfer (LIFT), uses laser-induced energy transfer to control deposition of bioinks. The LIFT system features an absorbing donor layer comprised of gold or titanium and a bioink layer beneath the donor layer. A focused laser beam vaporizes the donor layer, creating a high-pressure bubble that deposits the bioink to a substrate underneath, where it is subsequently crosslinked.[^(22)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29137814)^(,)[^(23)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4879088/) Laser-assisted methods are able to avoid problems with mechanical stresses and are capable of bioprinting viscous bioinks (1 - 300 mPa•s) with high cell viability and high resolution (10 - 100µm).[^(24)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1758-5090/8/3/032002/meta) However, the apparatus cost is high and scalability is an issue. For these reasons, laser-assisted methods are less likely to translate to the cell-based meat industry."

880,38,"**Other considerations**

In general, deriving cells from stem cells *in vitro* results in a variety of immature phenotypes such as size, shape, gene expression, and function, which collectively are more akin to a fetal state versus that of an adult. This phenomenon is most apparent under 2D culture conditions where a cell is restricted in 3D space, resulting in alterations in ECM-mediated mechanotransduction, [cell polarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_polarity), and cell-to-cell interactions.[^(79)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19472329) Additionally, exposure to cell culture media containing homogeneously distributed growth factors as opposed to dynamic spatial gradients can influence a variety of cellular behaviors.[^(80)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16410409) For these reasons, the further maturation of cells *in vitro* has been an important area of research for stem cell biologists, with consequences for structured cell-based meat products. For instance, immature myotubes may not contain the adult [sarcomeric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcomere) protein content needed for matched nutrition or texture to muscle from an adult animal.[^(81)](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/tswj/2016/3182746/) The methods previously discussed all aim to replicate the 3D *in vivo* environment in which cells grow, primarily through biomimicry of the ECM. Indeed, transplantation of stem cell-derived cells into an animal is the most well-characterized method to increase functional maturity.[^(82)](https://www.pnas.org/content/116/10/4346) However, additional methods can be utilized for the maturation of cells for cell-based meat production, discussed below. 

*In vivo*, skeletal muscle fibers and their collagen-rich ECM are highly aligned and thus [anisotropic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anisotropy). Therefore, in addition to mimicking porosity and other features of the ECM, growth of skeletal muscle on or within micro or nanopatterned topography can align, polarize, and increase the maturation state and functional output of myotubes.[^(83)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3341161/) For electrically active cells such as skeletal myotubes, stimulation can lead to well-described downstream gene transcriptional changes that can influence fiber type composition (discussed in Series V), maturation, and [hypertrophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_hypertrophy) (i.e. growth).[^(84)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3170710/) Electrical stimulation of skeletal muscle is mediated via the [neuromuscular junction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromuscular_junction) *in vivo*, however, in the absence of motor neuron input, similar effects can be accomplished via electrical pulse stimulation.[^(85)](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep04781) Additionally, myotube growth on conductive polymers such as [polyaniline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyaniline),[^(86)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19147222/) conductive coatings such as gold or titanium,[^(87)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5003176/) or in the presence of a static magnetic field,[^(88)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17694560/) can assist in myotube maturation in part via myotube alignment and propagation of intracellular calcium signaling through conductive surfaces or [gap junctions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gap_junction).[^(89)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17694560/) Lastly, many stem cell-derived populations of myotubes will spontaneously contract upon the development of [sarcomeric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcomere) structures that mediate contractility. In essence, the ability to “exercise” skeletal muscle *in vitro* is an important determinant in the overall size and maturation state of the cells, as demonstrated through [its use in the production of the first cell-based meat burger](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/test-tube-burger-lab-culture/). 

However, many studies investigating muscle contraction *in vitro* are nascent and at small scales, (often intentionally in the biorobotics field[^(90)](http://robotics.sciencemag.org/content/2/12/eaaq0495.abstract)), and have used structured pillars to act like tendons to assist in force generation[^(91)](https://www.pnas.org/content/111/28/10125) rather than structured collagen and sparse fibroblasts as may be seen *in vivo* or used within a scaffold. Thus, the selection of a strategy for ‘exercising’ cell-based meat within a bioreactor at large scale or within a scaffold may be challenging and require new innovations. For instance, direct electric current application to the cell culture medium can lead to ionization of medium components, and the intensity, frequency, and periodicity of stimulation will need to be optimized.[^(92)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/332309434_Electrical_Stimulation_Optimization_in_Bioreactors_for_Tissue_Engineering_Applications) Lastly, there is some concern for the structural integrity of a scaffold to withstand forces generated upon contraction; however, the forces generated thus far from muscle constructs *in vitro* are orders of magnitude lower than skeletal muscle *in vivo*[^(93)](http://robotics.sciencemag.org/content/2/12/eaaq0495.abstract) and are unlikely to pose significant problems for applications in cell-based meat. 

As discussed in Series II, one way to avoid [anoikis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anoikis) in suspension growth within a bioreactor is to grow cells as aggregates, spheroids, or organoids. A major benefit of this methodology is the 3D growth environment which permits a high degree of self-organization and maturation in relation to 2D growth.[^(94)](http://jcb.rupress.org/content/217/1/39) However, reproducibility in the relatively new organoid field is a challenge and an area of active research.[^(95)](http://dev.biologists.org/content/144/6/938) Additionally, transitioning cells from organoid growth onto a scaffold would be counterintuitive, as cells are already pre-patterned and self-organized. Thus, these methodologies may serve well for scaling cell numbers for direct use in unstructured products (discussed in Series V) but would not easily be incorporated into structured products utilizing scaffolds. A potential workaround to this could be the use of microfluidic spinning[^(96)](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmat3606) or coaxial microextrusion[^(97)](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1758-5090/aaa6b5) to produce cells encapsulated in a hydrogel core-shell tube structure. These techniques work by co-extruding cells within a hydrogel that can be readily crosslinked, such as alginate in the presence of calcium. By creating cell-laden tubes with a 400µm diameter, for instance, cells can readily proliferate within a 3D microenvironment without suffering from mass transport limitations, as oxygen, nutrients, and waste can pass through the porous hydrogel. Additionally, cells are shielded from shear forces within a bioreactor, remarkably high densities of up to 5x108 cells/mL of microspace can be achieved, and differentiation can be initiated via changes in culture mediums (discussed in Series IV).[^(98)](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsami.8b05780) The process is scalable in both tube length and parallelization of extruders. The tubes are flexible and structurally sound, permitting handling via ejection or suction and can be woven into complex structures using tools and methods similar to the highly automated textile industry.[^(99)](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmat3606) Furthermore, alginate can be dissolved in the presence of calcium chelators or enzymes, resulting in a purely cellular structure following handling. Thus, these strategies may provide non-obvious solutions for tackling various challenges associated with scale-up and creation of structured products."
